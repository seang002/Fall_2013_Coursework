BIOL6381 - 16867 Ethics in Biological Research SEC 02 - Fall 2013
=================================================================
First read the case below and answer the questions listed:
The Bakers couldn't decide what to do. The doctors were telling them that their brother, Mark, wouldn't live. He was in a coma after a motorcycle accident and wasn't breathing on his own. His electroencephalogram (brain wave) test was flat, meaning he had no brain function--he would never come out of the coma. 

Dr. Schwartz had explained that the hospital had recently allowed a family to use organs of a comatose patient for transplant. The Bakers thought this was an interesting idea, but when Dr. Schwartz checked with computerized organ donor/recipient bank he found that there were no people needing donors NOW. His suggestion was to operate on Mark and place infusion lines through a blood vessel in his leg. Through these lines, food could be infused into his body and waste products could be removed. This would make it possible to wait until someone needs the organs.

Oddly enough, Samatha Baker had recently read the book Coma by Robin Cook. In this book comatose patients were kept alive for farming of organs to people who needed them and could pay large amounts of money.
