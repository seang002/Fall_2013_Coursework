Ms. Lawrence Case

Martha Lawrence was very nervous when she went to the human genetics unit at the hospital. Her doctor had referred her because she was unexpectedly pregnant at age 41 and she was at risk for having a child with Down syndrome. She was 18 weeks (4+ months) which would not leave much time for an abortion considering the results of the amniocentesis takes 2 weeks.

Mothers of this age group have a 20 times higher chance of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality (one more, one less or other).

Ms. Lawrence has had two other pregnancies that were normal. Her other children are 13 and 17. The genetic counselor, Dr. Gould, suggested an amniocentesis (removal of fluid from around the fetus) to determine the karyotype of the fetus.

The test showed that the baby did not have an extra 21 chromosome and therefore did not have Downs. But the sex chromosomes showed an abnormal karyotype of XYY, Jacob's syndrome. Review what you know about XYY syndrome.
