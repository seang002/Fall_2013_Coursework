Case on Astrology

Judge Balkwin had never seen any case like it.  It wasn't that it was a murder case or that the defendant was pleading not guilty but the expert testimony that stunned him.

The defendant was accused of brutally stabbing a young girl to death after trying to steal her purse.  The victim had tried to hold on to her purse and when she wouldn't let go he stabbed her 15 times.  There were no fingerprints and no blood to test for DNA.  The defense attorney called Marianne Wexler as an expert witness on the last day of the trial.

Ms. Wexler was an expert on astrology.  She said that the defendant could not have committed such a violent crime because she had done his astrological chart and no one with his chart was violent.  She claimed he was born at a time when evil and violence were not present and therefore he was innocent.

Judge Balkwin looked at Ms. Wexler's resume and saw she was indeed an expert in astrology.  She had actually done the astrological charts for many people in Hollywood as well as two presidents.  Her services were in high demand and she charged as much as $1,000.00 for a reading.

The prosecuting attorney objected to the witness saying that she was not a scientist or a psychologist and therefore could not testify as to the innocence or guilt of the defendant.  Furthermore, she could not testify as to his ability or psychological need to commit murder because astrology was not a science.

2. Give three arguments the prosecution might give against Ms. Wexler's testimony.
3. Give three arguments the defense might have to allow Ms. Wexler's testimony.
4. List three things a court might use to determine if something is actually a science.
5. DNA fingerprinting was first brought up in court in 1982.  Many judges and jurors had never heard of DNA and didn't believe in it as evidence.  What is the difference between the DNA evidence and the astrology evidence?
6. research and find out if astrology has ever been in a legal case.  List your findings.
