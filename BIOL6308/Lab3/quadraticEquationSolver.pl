# Description:
# This program (name the program quadraticEquationSolver.pl) sould solve a
# quadratic equation of the form:
#
# ax**2+bx+c
#
# The program asks for three coefficients in order. Quadratic coefficient cannot
# be zero (a != 0.) The key to solve this equation is to calculate delta:
#
# delta = b**2 - 4ac
#
# Based on the sign of delta, three cases are possible:
#
# If delta is greater than zero then it has two separate roots:
#
# x1,x2 = (-b +/- delta) / 2a
#
# If delta is zero then it has a repeated root.
#
# If delta is less than zero, it doesnâ€™t have real roots, and you have to show
# an appropriate message.
