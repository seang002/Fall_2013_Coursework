Evidence for the alkaline nature of parental carbonatite melts at Oka complex in 
Canada.

Chen W, Kamenetsky VS, Simonetti A.

Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, University 
of Notre Dame, 156 Fitzpatrick Hall, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556, USA.

The Earth's sole active carbonatite volcano, Oldoinyo Lengai (Tanzania), is
presently erupting unique natrocarbonatite lavas that are characterized by Na-
and K-bearing magmatic carbonates of nyerereite [Na2Ca(CO3)2] and gregoryite
[(Na2,K2,Ca)CO3]. Contrarily, the vast majority of older, plutonic carbonatite
occurrences worldwide are dominated by Ca-(calcite) or Mg-(dolomite)-rich
magmatic carbonates. Consequently, this leads to the conundrum as to the
composition of primary, mantle-derived carbonatite liquids. Here we report a
detailed chemical investigation of melt inclusions associated with intrusive
(plutonic) calcite-rich carbonatites from the ~120â€‰Ma carbonatite complex of Oka 
(Canada). Melt inclusions are hosted by magnetite (Fe3O4), which crystallizes
through a significant period of carbonatite melt solidification. Our results
indicate mineral assemblages within the melt inclusions that are consistent with 
those documented in natrocarbonatite lavas. We propose therefore that derivation 
of alkali-enriched parental carbonatite melts has been more prevalent than that
preserved in the geological record.

Health system support for childbirth care in Southern Tanzania: results from a
health facility census.

Hanson C, Ronsmans C, Penfold S, Maokola W, Manzi F, Jaribu J, Mbaruku G, Mshinda
H, Tanner M, Schellenberg J.

BACKGROUND: Progress towards reaching Millennium Development Goals four (child
health) and five (maternal health) is lagging behind, particularly in sub-Saharan
Africa, despite increasing efforts to scale up high impact interventions.
Increasing the proportion of birth attended by a skilled attendant is a main
indicator of progress, but not much is known about the quality of childbirth care
delivered by these skilled attendants. With a view to reducing maternal mortality
through health systems improvement we describe the care routinely offered in
childbirth offered at dispensaries, health centres and hospitals in five
districts in rural Southern Tanzania. We use data from a health facility census
assessing 159 facilities in five districts in early 2009. A structural and
operational assessment was undertaken based on staff reports using a modular
questionnaire assessing staffing, work load, equipment and supplies as well as
interventions routinely implemented during childbirth.
RESULTS: Health centres and dispensaries attended a median of eight and four
deliveries every month respectively. Dispensaries had a median of 2.5 (IQR 2--3) 
health workers including auxiliary staff instead of the recommended four clinical
officer and certified nurses. Only 28% of first-line facilities (dispensaries and
health centres) reported offering active management in the third stage of labour 
(AMTSL). Essential childbirth care comprising eight interventions including
AMTSL, infection prevention, partograph use including foetal monitoring and
newborn care including early breastfeeding, thermal care at birth and prevention 
of ophthalmia neonatorum was offered by 5% of dispensaries, 38% of health centres
and 50% of hospitals consistently. No first-line facility had provided all signal
functions for emergency obstetric complications in the previous six months.
CONCLUSION: Essential interventions for childbirth care are not routinely
implemented in first-line facilities or hospitals. Dispensaries have both low
staffing and low caseload which constraints the ability to provide high-quality
childbirth care. Improvements in quality of care are essential so that women
delivering in facility receive "skilled attendance" and adequate care for common 
obstetric complications such as post-partum haemorrhage.

Isozyme polymorphism and organization of the agamic complex of the Maximae
(Panicum maximum Jacq., P. infestum Anders, and P. trichocladum K. Schum.) in
Tanzania.

Assienan B, Noirot M.

Laboratoire de GÃ©nÃ©tique, Centre IIRSDA d'AdiopodoumÃ©, B.P. V51, Abidjan,
CÃ´te-d'Ivoire.

The tribe Maximae (Panicum maximum Jacq., P. infestum Anders., P. trichocladum K.
Schum.) includes two sympatric pools with different modes of reproduction and
ploidy levels: an apomictic and tetraploid pool on the one hand, and a smaller,
sexual and diploid pool on the other. From an analysis of isozyme polymorphism
five main results were evident. First, overall polymorphism is considerable
showing that apomixis does not lead to a reduction in diversity. Second, the
isozyme polymorphism of the two pools is similar, and this may be explained by
reciprocal gene flow (low, but continuous) between these two pools. Third,
maximum local polymorphism is due to the simultaneous presence of P. maximum
sexuals and P. infestum apomicts. A continuum exists between the two species.
Fourth, a high proportion of rare alleles, arising from introgression from P.
infestum, characterized the isozyme polymorphism. These rare alleles, strongly
counter-selected at the diploid level, are maintained by apomixis; the frequency 
of triplex or quadruplex genotypes was nevertheless low. Fifth, the
heterozygosity level within apomicts is not higher than that of sexuals, showing 
that the apomixis-polyploidy combination does not lead to a higher frequency of
very heterozygous individuals.

Can iron supplementation be reconciled with benefits and risks in areas
hyperendemic for malaria?

Schümann K, Solomons NW.

Research Center for Nutrition and Food Science (ZIEL), Technische Universität
München, Am Forum 5, D-85350 Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany.
KSchuemann@hgrunowfoundation.org

Malaria is associated with about a million fatalities annually, largely among
young children in zones of intense malarial transmission. The last thing needed
would be measures that might increase the severity of clinical malaria. Thus, the
finding in a field trial on Pemba Island, Tanzania, that routine oral iron
supplementation produced adverse effects in iron-sufficient subjects had a ripple
effect throughout the international public health community; it has effectively
paralyzed efforts to redress iron-deficiency anemia in malaria-endemic regions.
From a Hippocratic perspective, we consider the de facto moratorium on oral
supplementation in such circumstance as a prudent interim measure. Public health 
programs to combat iron-deficiency anemia cannot be denied indefinitely to
malaria-endemic populations, but the universal campaigns of iron provision cannot
simply resume in the manner of the past. Contemporary biological and
epidemiological understanding of the coevolution of humans and their pathogens
should be able to provide guidance within the context of the essential and
harmful aspects of iron. From these evolutionary standpoints, we identify a
series of unresolved dilemmas. Toward a way forward, we highlight the pros and
cons, as well as possible directions toward short-term strengthening, within
three domains: tailored oral iron compounds, iron administration targeted only to
iron-deficient individuals through screening, and prudent use of antimalarial
prophylaxis. Although the tension between the essentiality of iron for humans and
its role in pathogen virulence looms through every consideration, this
recognition is a starting point toward the weighing of appropriate options
balancing benefits and safety.

Beyond antimalarial stock-outs: implications of health provider compliance on
out-of-pocket expenditure during care-seeking for fever in South East Tanzania.

Mikkelsen-Lopez I, Tediosi F, Abdallah G, Njozi M, Amuri B, Khatib R, Manzi F, de
Savigny D.

BACKGROUND: To better understand how stock-outs of the first line antimalarial,
Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) and other non-compliant health worker
behaviour, influence household expenditures during care-seeking for fever in the 
Ulanga District in Tanzania.
METHODS: We combined weekly ACT stock data for the period 2009-2011 from six
health facilities in the Ulanga District in Tanzania, together with household
data from 333 respondents on the cost of fever care-seeking in Ulanga during the 
same time period to establish how health seeking behaviour and expenditure might 
vary depending on ACT availability in their nearest health facility.
RESULTS: Irrespective of ACT stock-outs, more than half (58%) of respondents
sought initial care in the public sector, the remainder seeking care in the
private sector where expenditure was higher by 19%. Over half (54%) of
respondents who went to the public sector reported incidences of non-compliant
behaviour by the attending health worker (e.g. charging those who were eligible
for free service or referring patients to the private sector despite ACT stock), 
which increased household expenditure per fever episode from USD0.14 to USD1.76. 
ACT stock-outs were considered to be the result of non-compliant behaviour of
others in the health system and increased household expenditure by 21%; however
we lacked sufficient statistical power to confirm this finding.
CONCLUSION: System design and governance challenges in the Tanzanian health
system have resulted in numerous ACT stock-outs and frequent non-compliant public
sector health worker behaviour, both of which increase out-of-pocket health
expenditure. Interventions are urgently needed to ensure a stable supply of ACT
in the public sector and increase health worker accountability.

Reviewing progress: 7 year trends in characteristics of adults and children
enrolled at HIV care and treatment clinics in the United Republic of Tanzania.

Nuwagaba-Biribonwoha H, Kilama B, Antelman G, Khatib A, Almeida A, Reidy W,
Ramadhani G, Lamb MR, Mbatia R, Abrams EJ.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the on-going scale-up of HIV programs, we assessed trends
in patient characteristics at enrolment and ART initiation over 7 years of
implementation.
METHODS: Data were from Optimal Models, a prospective open cohort study of
HIV-infected (HIV+) adults (>=15 years) and children (<15 years) enrolled from
January 2005 to December 2011 at 44 HIV clinics in 3 regions of mainland Tanzania
(Kagera, Kigoma, Pwani) and Zanzibar. Comparative statistics for trends in
characteristics of patients enrolled in 2005--2007, 2008--2009 and 2010--2011
were examined.
RESULTS: Overall 62,801 HIV+ patients were enrolled: 58,102(92.5%) adults, (66.5%
female); 4,699(7.5%) children.Among adults, pregnant women enrolment increased:
6.8%, 2005--2007; 12.1%, 2008--2009; 17.2%, 2010--2011; as did entry into care
from prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs: 6.6%,
2005--2007; 9.5%, 2008--2009; 12.6%, 2010--2011. WHO stage IV at enrolment
declined: 27.1%, 2005--2007; 20.2%, 2008--2009; 11.1% 2010--2011. Of the 42.5%
and 29.5% with CD4+ data at enrolment and ART initiation respectively, median
CD4+ count increased: 210cells/muL, 2005--2007; 262cells/muL, 2008--2009;
266cells/muL 2010--2011; but median CD4+ at ART initiation did not change
(148cells/muL overall). Stavudine initiation declined: 84.9%, 2005--2007; 43.1%, 
2008--2009; 19.7%, 2010--2011.Among children, median age (years) at enrolment
decreased from 6.1(IQR:2.7-10.0) in 2005--2007 to 4.8(IQR:1.9-8.6) in 2008--2009,
and 4.1(IQR:1.5-8.1) in 2010--2011 and children <24 months increased from 18.5%
to 26.1% and 31.5% respectively. Entry from PMTCT was 7.0%, 2005--2007; 10.7%,
2008--2009; 15.0%, 2010--2011. WHO stage IV at enrolment declined from 22.9%,
2005--2007, to 18.3%, 2008--2009 to 13.9%, 2010--2011. Proportion initiating
stavudine was 39.8% 2005--2007; 39.5%, 2008--2009; 26.1%, 2010--2011. Median age 
at ART initiation also declined significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: Over time, the proportion of pregnant women and of adults and
children enrolled from PMTCT programs increased. There was a decline in adults
and children with advanced HIV disease at enrolment and initiation of stavudine. 
Pediatric age at enrolment and ART initiation declined. Results suggest HIV
program maturation from an emergency response.

Efficacy of in-service nutrition training for mid-level providers to improve
feeding practices among HIV-positive children in Tanga, Tanzania: study protocol 
for a cluster randomized controlled trial.

Sunguya BF, Poudel KC, Mlunde LB, Urassa DP, Jimba M, Yasuoka J.

BACKGROUND: Feeding practices and child undernutrition can be improved when
trained health workers provide proper nutrition counseling to caregivers.
However, this important management component is difficult to achieve in countries
where trained health workers are limited; Tanzania is no exception. In rural and 
semi-urban areas, mid-level providers (MLPs) are left to manage diseases such as 
HIV/AIDS.Training health workers in nutrition has been shown to be an effective
intervention among HIV-negative children elsewhere, but no studies have been
conducted among HIV-positive children. Furthermore, in Tanzania and other
countries with MLPs, no evidence currently exists demonstrating an improvement in
nutrition among children who receive health services given by MLPs. This study
thus aims to examine the efficacy of nutrition training of MLPs on feeding
practices and the nutrition status of HIV-positive children in Tanga,
Tanzania.Methods/design: We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in
care and treatment centers (CTCs) in Tanga, Tanzania. The CTCs will be the unit
of randomization. We will select 16 CTCs out of 32 for this study, of which we
will randomly assign 8 to the intervention arm and 8 to the control arm by coin
flipping. From the selected CTCs we will attempt to recruit a total of 800
HIV-positive children aged 6 months to 14 years, half of whom will be receiving
care and/or treatment in the CTCs of the intervention arm, and the other half of 
whom will be receiving care and/or treatment in the CTCs of the control arm (400 
children in each condition).We will provide nutrition training to MLPs of the
CTCs selected for the intervention arm. In this intervention, we will use the
World Health Organization guidelines on nutrition training of health workers for 
HIV-positive children aged 6 months to 14 years. The trained MLPs will then
provide tailored nutrition counseling to caregivers of children being treated at 
the 8 CTCs of the intervention arm. We will measure nutrition status and child
feeding practices monthly for a total of six months.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this trial will help expanding undernutrition
interventions among HIV-positive children in Tanzania and other countries.Trial
registration: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN65346364.

Attitudes, beliefs and norms relating to contraceptive use among young migrant
and non-migrant adults in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Irani L, Speizer I, Barrington C.

a Department of Maternal and Child Health , University of North Carolina Gillings
School of Global Public Health , Chapel Hill , NC , USA.

The young urban population of Tanzania is growing rapidly, primarily due to
rural-urban migration. More information is needed on the challenges facing young 
adult urban women and men in using family planning (FP). The purpose of this
study is to identify perceptions, interpersonal and familial attitudes, and
sociocultural norms regarding FP among young adults (18-25 years) in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, comparing responses by sex, marital status and migration
status. We conducted 12 focus groups with young adult men and women (n = 74) in
Dar es Salaam in December 2009. Participants knew of modern contraceptive
methods, but had serious concerns about side effects. Single men and women
preferred condoms. Female migrants stated that traditional methods were
ineffective, yet commonly used in rural areas. Men's desires for more children
frequently led female migrants not to use FP, while many married long-term
residents used FP discreetly. Single women sometimes received the support of
their parents/boyfriends to access and use contraception. Findings highlight
differences in experiences among young adult men and women based on their migrant
and marital status at the individual, interpersonal and normative levels. Future 
efforts to promote FP should engage existing social support systems and cultivate
new ones in response to barriers.

Masculine attitudes of superiority deter men from accessing antiretroviral
therapy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Nyamhanga TM, Muhondwa EP, Shayo R.

Department of Development Studies, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied
Sciences, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; tumaininyamhanga@yahoo.com.

Background: This article presents part of the findings from a larger study that
sought to assess the role that gender relations play in influencing equity
regarding access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Review of the
literature has indicated that, in Southern and Eastern Africa, fewer men than
women have been accessing ART, and the former start using ART late, after HIV has
already been allowed to advance. The main causes for this gender gap have not yet
been fully explained. Objective: To explore how masculinity norms limit men's
access to ART in Dar es Salaam. Design: This article is based on a qualitative
study that involved the use of focus group discussions (FGDs). The study employed
a stratified purposive sampling technique to recruit respondents. The study also 
employed a thematic analysis approach. Results: Overall, the study's findings
revealed that men's hesitation to visit the care and treatment clinics signifies 
the superiority norm of masculinity that requires men to avoid displaying
weakness. Since men are the heads of families and have higher social status, they
reported feeling embarrassed at having to visit the care and treatment clinics.
Specifically, male respondents indicated that going to a care and treatment
clinic may raise suspicion about their status of living with HIV, which in turn
may compromise their leadership position and cause family instability. Because of
this tendency towards 'hiding', the few men who register at the public care and
treatment clinics do so late, when HIV-related signs and symptoms are already far
advanced. Conclusion: This study suggests that the superiority norm of
masculinity affects men's access to ART. Societal expectations of a 'real man' to
be fearless, resilient, and emotionally stable are in direct conflict with
expectations of the treatment programme that one has to demonstrate
health-promoting behaviour, such as promptness in attending the care and
treatment clinic, agreeing to take HIV tests, and disclosing one's status of
living with HIV to at least one's spouse or partner. Hence, there is a need for
HIV control agencies to design community-based programmes that will stimulate
dialogue on the deconstruction of masculinity notions.

Fitzgerald DW, Peck RN.

Department of Medicine, Bugando Medical Centre and Weill Bugando School of
Medicine, Mwanza, Tanzania.

AIMS: Diabetes increases the risk of tuberculosis and the prevalence of diabetes 
is rising in tuberculosis-endemic regions such as sub-Saharan Africa.
Resource-appropriate strategies for tuberculosis case finding among African
adults with diabetes are needed. The aims of this study were to determine
prevalence of tuberculosis and evaluate one screening strategy among adult
Tanzanians with diabetes.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated a 'cough-triggered'
strategy for tuberculosis case finding among adults with diabetes at our zonal
hospital in Tanzania. All adults with diabetes and cough underwent further
tuberculosis symptom assessment, and those with productive cough had sputum
collected for microscopy and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture.
RESULTS: Between September 2011 and March 2012, 700 adults with diabetes attended
our hospital. A total of 693 were enrolled, 121/693 (17.5%) had cough and 32/693 
(4.6%) had at least two of the classic symptoms of tuberculosis. Of note, 87/121 
(71.9%) of patients with cough could not produce sputum spontaneously. Nine
patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis for a prevalence of 1299/100Â 000
(1.3%), sevenfold greater than the national average.
CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is common among Tanzanian adults with diabetes, but
tuberculosis case finding is challenging because of the high prevalence of
non-productive cough. This low-cost, 'cough-triggered' tuberculosis case-finding 
strategy may serve as a reasonable first step for improving tuberculosis
screening among adults with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. This article is

Health, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland ;
University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: Gaining and sustaining control of schistosomiasis and, whenever
feasible, achieving local elimination are the year 2020 targets set by the World 
Health Organization. In Zanzibar, various institutions and stakeholders have
joined forces to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis within 5 years. We report
baseline findings before the onset of a randomized intervention trial designed to
assess the differential impact of community-based praziquantel administration,
snail control, and behavior change interventions.
METHODOLOGY: In early 2012, a baseline parasitological survey was conducted in
âˆ¼20,000 people from 90 communities in Unguja and Pemba. Risk factors for
schistosomiasis were assessed by administering a questionnaire to adults. In
selected communities, local knowledge about schistosomiasis transmission and
prevention was determined in focus group discussions and in-depths interviews.
Intermediate host snails were collected and examined for shedding of cercariae.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The baseline Schistosoma haematobium prevalence in school
children and adults was 4.3% (range: 0-19.7%) and 2.7% (range: 0-26.5%) in
Unguja, and 8.9% (range: 0-31.8%) and 5.5% (range: 0-23.4%) in Pemba,
respectively. Heavy infections were detected in 15.1% and 35.6% of the positive
school children in Unguja and Pemba, respectively. Males were at higher risk than
females (odds ratio (OR): 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-2.03).
Decreasing adult age (OR: 1.04; CI: 1.02-1.06), being born in Pemba (OR: 1.48;
CI: 1.02-2.13) or Tanzania (OR: 2.36; CI: 1.16-4.78), and use of freshwater (OR: 
2.15; CI: 1.53-3.03) showed higher odds of infection. Community knowledge about
schistosomiasis was low. Only few infected Bulinus snails were found.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The relatively low S. haematobium prevalence in
Zanzibar is a promising starting point for elimination. However, there is a need 
to improve community knowledge about disease transmission and prevention. Control
measures tailored to the local context, placing particular attention to hot-spot 
areas, high-risk groups, and individuals, will be necessary if elimination is to 
be achieved.

Porcine cysticercosis (PC) caused by the larval stage of a zoonotic tapeworm
Taenia solium, is known to pose serious economic losses and public health risk
among smallholder pig production communities. The present study was conducted to 
determine prevalence and associated risk factors for PC in smallholder pig
production systems in Mbeya region, the major pig rearing region of Tanzania. A
cross-sectional survey employing a random sample of 300 pig keepers from 30
villages of Mbozi and Mbeya Rural districts, Mbeya region were used to evaluate
pig production systems and practices. Concurrently, 600 male and female pigs of
different age categories were randomly selected and examined for PC using lingual
examination method and antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA). The 
overall pig level PC prevalence in Mbozi district was 11.7% (95% CI=8.5-15.8%)
and 32% (95% CI: 27-37.5%) based on lingual examination and Ag-ELISA,
respectively. In Mbeya Rural district, the prevalences were 6% (95% CI: 3.8-9.3%)
and 30.7% (95% CI: 25.8-36.1%) by lingual examination and Ag-ELISA, respectively.
In Mbozi district 46% of the households were found infected (one or more infected
pigs) and the corresponding figure was 45% for Mbeya Rural district. The
agreement between lingual examination and Ag-ELISA was poor (Îº<0.40). There were 
no significant differences in the prevalence of PC in different sex categories of
pigs. Significant risk factors associated with PC prevalence were free roaming of
pigs (OR=2.1; 95% CI=1.3-3.6; p=0.006), past experience of porcine cysticercosis 
in the household (OR=2.6; 95% CI=1.5-4.8; p=0.002), increased age of pig (OR=1.9;
95% CI=1.2-3.0), slatted raised floor in pig pen (OR=8.4; 95% CI=1.0-70.0),
in-house origin of the pig (OR=1.6; 95% CI=1.1-2.5) and sourcing of water from
rivers (OR=3.1; 95% CI=1.6-6.3; p<0.001) and ponds (OR=5.0; 95% CI=1.2-21.7;
p=0.031). This study has clearly revealed a high sero-prevalence of PC in the
study area, which imposes a major economical and public health burden to the
smallholder pig farmers. The study also points to a number of important risk
factors in smallholder pig management that may be addressed (e.g. confinement,
quality of pens and water sources) in future interventions and educational
campaigns for control of T. solium.

Predicting distribution of Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens complex, potential
vectors of Rift Valley fever virus in relation to disease epidemics in East
Africa.

Mweya CN, Kimera SI, Kija JB, Mboera LE.

National Institute for Medical Research, Tukuyu Research Centre, Tukuyu, Tanzania
; Department of Veterinary Medicine and Public Health, Sokoine University of
Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: The East African region has experienced several Rift Valley fever
(RVF) outbreaks since the 1930s. The objective of this study was to identify
distributions of potential disease vectors in relation to disease epidemics.
Understanding disease vector potential distributions is a major concern for
disease transmission dynamics.
METHODS: DIVERSE ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELLING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR
THIS PURPOSE: we present a maximum entropy (Maxent) approach for estimating
distributions of potential RVF vectors in un-sampled areas in East Africa. We
modelled the distribution of two species of mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Culex
pipiens complex) responsible for potential maintenance and amplification of the
virus, respectively. Predicted distributions of environmentally suitable areas in
East Africa were based on the presence-only occurrence data derived from our
entomological study in Ngorongoro District in northern Tanzania.
RESULTS: Our model predicted potential suitable areas with high success rates of 
90.9% for A. aegypti and 91.6% for C. pipiens complex. Model performance was
statistically significantly better than random for both species. Most suitable
sites for the two vectors were predicted in central and northwestern Tanzania
with previous disease epidemics. Other important risk areas include western Lake 
Victoria, northern parts of Lake Malawi, and the Rift Valley region of Kenya.
CONCLUSION: Findings from this study show distributions of vectors had biological
and epidemiological significance in relation to disease outbreak hotspots, and
hence provide guidance for the selection of sampling areas for RVF vectors during
inter-epidemic periods.

Urban lymphatic filariasis in the city of Tanga, Tanzania, after seven rounds of 
mass drug administration.

National Institute for Medical Research, P.O. Box 9653, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 
Electronic address: mbuto_esta@hotmail.com.

Urban lymphatic filariasis (LF) has been listed among the challenges to the
ongoing global efforts to eliminate LF. This is partly because the control
strategies developed for rural areas - where most LF occurs - do not easily
comply with human organization and behaviour in urban areas, and partly because
the urban vectors thrive and proliferate in poorly planned urban settlements.
This study investigated LF infection, disease and transmission in the
medium-sized city of Tanga (approx. 300,000 inhabitants), Tanzania, after seven
rounds of mass drug administration (MDA). Three representative sites with varying
distance from the city centre were selected for the study. Pupils from one public
primary school at each site were screened for circulating filarial antigens (CFA;
marker of adult worm infection) and antibodies to Bm14 (marker of exposure to
transmission). Community members were examined for CFA, microfilariae and chronic
manifestations. Questionnaires were administered to pupils and heads of community
households, and vector surveys were carried out in selected households. Although 
there was evidence of considerable reduction in infection and transmission, there
was still LF in the city, with mf and CFA prevalences well above the cut-off
levels for stopping MDA. In this respect, the LF situation resembled that seen in
nearby rural areas outside the city. The study emphasizes the importance of
motivating the urban individuals to engage and comply with the full range of LF
intervention measures (MDAs, use of mosquito proofing measures including bed
nets, environmental sanitation to prevent vector breeding) in order to reach
successful LF control in the city. The high LF disease burden noted, despite the 
reduction in infection and transmission, moreover emphasizes the importance of
allocating resources for morbidity management, to ensure true elimination of LF
as a public health problem.

Cytokine Profiles at Birth Predict Malaria Severity during Infancy.

Kabyemela E, GonÃ§alves BP, Prevots DR, Morrison R, Harrington W, Gwamaka M,
Kurtis JD, Fried M, Duffy PE.

MOMS Project, Seattle Biomedical Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, United 
States of America, and Muheza Designated District Hospital, Muheza, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Severe malaria risk varies between individuals, and most of this
variation remains unexplained. Here, we examined the hypothesis that cytokine
profiles at birth reflect inter-individual differences that persist and influence
malaria parasite density and disease severity throughout early childhood.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cytokine levels (TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and 
IL-10) were measured at birth (cord blood; N=783) and during subsequent routine
follow-up visits (peripheral blood) for children enrolled between 2002 and 2006
into a birth cohort in Muheza, Tanzania. Children underwent blood smear and
clinical assessments every 2-4 weeks, and at the time of any illness. Cord blood 
levels of all cytokines were positively correlated with each other (Spearman's
rank correlation). Cord levels of IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± (but not other cytokines)
correlated with levels of the same cytokine measured at routine visits during
early life (P < 0.05). Higher cord levels of IL-1Î² but not TNF-Î± were associated 
with lower parasite densities during infancy (P=0.003; Generalized Estimating
Equation (GEE) method), with an average ~40% reduction versus children with low
cord IL-1Î² levels, and with decreased risk of severe malaria during follow-up
(Cox regression): adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.60 (0.39-0.92), P = 0.02.
CONCLUSION: IL-1Î² levels at birth are related to future IL-1Î² levels as well as
the risk of severe malaria in early life. The effect on severe malaria risk may
be due in part to the effect of inflammatory cytokines to control parasite
density.

On the effects of malaria treatment on parasite drug resistance--probability
modelling of genotyped malaria infections.

Kum CK, Thorburn D, Ghilagaber G, Gil P, Björkman A.

We compare the frequency of resistant genes of malaria parasites before treatment
and at first malaria incidence after treatment. The data come from a clinical
trial at two health facilities in Tanzania and concerns single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) at three positions believed to be related to resistance to
malaria treatment. A problem is that mixed infections are common, which both
obscures the underlying frequency of alleles at each locus as well as the
associations between loci in samples where alleles are mixed. We use
combinatorics and quite involved probability methods to handle multiple
infections and multiple haplotypes. The infection with the different haplotypes
seemed to be independent of each other. We showed that at two of the three
studied SNPs, the proportion of resistant genes had increased after treatment
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone but when treated in combination with
artesunate, no effect was noticed. First recurrences of malaria associated more
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone as treatment than when in combination with
artesunate. We also found that the recruited children had two different ongoing
malaria infections where the parasites had different gene types.

Integrating the Management of Ruaha Landscape of Tanzania with Local Needs and
Preferences.

Masozera M, Erickson JD, Clifford D, Coppolillo P, Sadiki HG, Mazet JK.

Widlife Conservation Society - Africa Program, P.o. Box: 1699, Kigali, Rwanda,
mmasozera@wcs.org.

Sustainable management of landscapes with multiple competing demands such as the 
Ruaha Landscape is complex due to the diverse preferences and needs of
stakeholder groups involved. This study uses conjoint analysis to assess the
preferences of representatives from three stakeholder groups-local communities,
district government officials, and non-governmental organizations-toward
potential solutions of conservation and development tradeoffs facing local
communities in the Ruaha Landscape of Tanzania. Results demonstrate that there is
little consensus among stakeholders about the best development strategies for the
Ruaha region. This analysis suggests a need for incorporating issues deemed
important by these various groups into a development strategy that aims to
promote conservation of the Ruaha Landscape and improve the livelihood of local
communities.

Involving traditional birth attendants in emergency obstetric care in Tanzania:
policy implications of a study of their knowledge and practices in Kigoma Rural
District.

Vyagusa DB, Mubyazi GM, Masatu M.

INTRODUCTION: Access to quality maternal health services mainly depends on
existing policies, regulations, skilled and knowledge, perceptions, and economic 
power and motivation of service givers and target users. Critics question policy 
recommending involvement of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in emergency
obstetric care (EmoC) services in developing countries.ObjectivesThis paper
reports about knowledge and practices of TBAs on EmoC in Kigoma Rural District,
Tanzania and discusses policy implications on involving TBAs in maternal health
services.
METHODS: 157 TBAs were identified from several villages in 2005, interviewed and 
observed on their knowledge and practice in relation to EmoC. Quantitative and
qualitative techniques were used for data collection and analysis depending on
the nature of the information required.
FINDINGS: Among a total of 157 TBAs approached, 57.3% were aged 50+ years while
50% had no formal education. Assisting mothers to deliver without taking their
full pregnancy history was confessed by 11% of all respondents. Having been
attending pregnant women with complications was experienced by 71.2% of all
respondents. Only 58% expressed adequate knowledge on symptoms and signs of
pregnancy complications. Lack of knowledge on possible risk of HIV infections
while assisting childbirth without taking protective gears was claimed by 5.7% of
the respondents. Sharing the same pair of gloves between successful deliveries
was reported to be a common practice by 21.1% of the respondents. Use of unsafe
delivery materials including local herbs and pieces of cloth for protecting
themselves against HIV infections was reported as being commonly practiced among 
27.6% of the respondents. Vaginal examination before and during delivery was done
by only a few respondents.
CONCLUSION: TBAs in Tanzania are still consulted by people living in underserved 
areas. Unfortunately, TBAs' inadequate knowledge on EmOC issues seems to have
contributed to the rising concerns about their competence to deliver the
recommended maternal services. Thus, the authorities seeming to recognize and
promote TBAs should provide support to TBAs in relation to necessary training and
giving them essential working facilities, routine supportive supervision and
rewarding those seeming to comply with the standard guidelines for delivering
EmoC services.

Trauma history and depression predict incomplete adherence to antiretroviral
therapies in a low income country.

Center for Health Policy, Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, Durham, 
North Carolina, United States of America ; Duke Global Health Institute, Duke
University, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: As antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV becomes increasingly
available in low and middle income countries (LMICs), understanding reasons for
lack of adherence is critical to stemming the tide of infections and improving
health. Understanding the effect of psychosocial experiences and mental health
symptomatology on ART adherence can help maximize the benefit of expanded ART
programs by indicating types of services, which could be offered in combination
with HIV care.
METHODOLOGY: The Coping with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania (CHAT) study is a longitudinal 
cohort study in the Kilimanjaro Region that included randomly selected
HIV-infected (HIV+) participants from two local hospital-based HIV clinics and
four free-standing voluntary HIV counselling and testing sites. Baseline data
were collected in 2008 and 2009; this paper used data from 36 month follow-up
interviews (Nâ€Š=â€Š468). Regression analyses were used to predict factors associated
with incomplete self-reported adherence to ART.
RESULTS: INCOMPLETE ART ADHERENCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE REPORTED
AMONGST PARTICIPANTS WHO EXPERIENCED A GREATER NUMBER OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMATIC
EVENTS: sexual abuse prior to puberty and the death in childhood of an immediate 
family member not from suicide or homicide were significantly more likely in the 
non-adherent group and other negative childhood events trended toward being more 
likely. Those with incomplete adherence had higher depressive symptom severity
and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In multivariable analyses, childhood
trauma, depression, and financial sacrifice remained associated with incomplete
adherence.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study to examine the effect of childhood trauma,
depression and PTSD on HIV medication adherence in a low income country facing a 
significant burden of HIV. Allocating spending on HIV/AIDS toward integrating
mental health services with HIV care is essential to the creation of systems that
enhance medication adherence and maximize the potential of expanded
antiretroviral access to improve health and reduce new infections.

Risky behaviours among young people living with HIV attending care and treatment 
clinics in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania: implications for prevention with a positive
approach.

Mhalu A, Leyna GH, Mmbaga EJ.

Management and Development for Health, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.

Introduction: Prevention with a positive approach has been advocated as one of
the main strategies to reduce new instances of HIV infection. Risky sexual
behaviours among people living with HIV/AIDS are the cornerstone for this
approach. Understanding the extent to which infected individuals practice risky
behaviours is fundamental in designing appropriate population-specific
interventions. With the HIV infection transmission rates remaining high among
young people in sub-Saharan Africa, continued prevention among them remains a
priority. This study therefore seeks to describe the magnitude and determinants
of risky sexual behaviours among young people living with HIV. Methods: A
cross-sectional study was conducted between June and July 2010 in selected Care
and Treatment Clinics (CTCs) in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. A total of 282
HIV-positive patients aged 15-24 were interviewed about their sexual behaviours
using a questionnaire. Results: Prevalence of unprotected sex was 40.0% among
young males and 37.5% among young females (p<0.001). Multiple sexual partnerships
were reported by 10.6% of males and 15.9% of females (p<0.005). More than 50% of 
the participants did not know about the HIV status of their sexual partners. A
large proportion of participants had minimal knowledge of transmission (46.7%
males vs. 60.4% females) and prevention (65.3% males vs. 73.4% females) of
sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Independent predictors of condom use
included non-use of alcohol [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.40 95% confidence
interval (CI); 0.17-0.84] and younger age (15-19 years) (AOR, 2.76, 95% CI:
1.05-7.27). Being on antiretroviral therapy (AOR, 0.38, 95% CI: 0.17-0.85) and
not knowing partners' HIV sero-status (AOR, 2.62, 95% CI: 1.14-5.10) predicted
the practice of multiple sexual partnership. Conclusions: Unprotected sex and
multiple sexual partnerships were prevalent among young people living with HIV.
Less knowledge on STI and lack of HIV disclosure increased the vulnerability and 
risk for HIV transmission among young people. Specific intervention measures
addressing alcohol consumption, risky sexual behaviours, and STI transmission and
prevention knowledge should be integrated in the routine HIV/AIDS care and
treatment offered to this age group.

Antimicrobial resistance in human and animal pathogens in Zambia, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Mozambique and Tanzania: an urgent need of a sustainable
surveillance system.

Mshana SE, Matee M, Rweyemamu M.

A review of the published and unpublished literature on bacterial resistance in
human and animals was performed. Sixty-eight articles/reports from the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia were reviewed. The
majority of these articles were from Tanzania. There is an increasing trend in
the incidence of antibiotic resistance; of major concern is the increase in
multidrug- resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
aureus, Vibrio cholera, non-typhoid Salmonella and other pathogens responsible
for nosocomial infections. The increase in methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers in the countries
under review confirms the spread of these clones worldwide. Clinical microbiology
services in these countries need to be strengthened in order to allow a
coordinated surveillance for antimicrobial resistance and provide data for local 
treatment guidelines and for national policies to control antimicrobial
resistance. While the present study does not provide conclusive evidence to
associate the increasing trend in antibiotic resistance in humans with the use of
antibiotics in animals, either as feed additives or veterinary prescription, we
strongly recommend a one-health approach of systematic surveillance across the
public and animal health sectors, as well as the adherence to the FAO (Food and
Agriculture Organization)-OIE (World Organization of animal Health) --WHO(World
Health Organization) recommendations for non-human antimicrobial usage.

Counselling on and women's awareness of pregnancy danger signs in selected rural 
health facilities in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Tanzania.

Loukanova S, Temmerman M.

International Centre for Reproductive Health, Department of Uro-Gynaecology,
Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (i) assess healthcare workers'
counselling practices concerning danger signs during antenatal consultations in
rural primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Tanzania; to
(ii) assess pregnant women's awareness of these danger signs; and (iii) to
identify factors affecting counselling practices and women's awareness.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study in rural PHC facilities in Burkina Faso, Ghana and
Tanzania. In each country, 12 facilities were randomly selected. WHO guidelines
were used as standard for good counselling. We assessed providers' counselling
practice on seven danger signs through direct observation study (35
observations/facility). Exit interviews (63 interviews/facility) were used to
assess women's awareness of the same seven danger signs. We used negative
binomial regression to assess associations with health services' and
socio-demographic characteristics and to estimate per study site the average
number of danger signs on which counselling was provided and the average number
of danger signs mentioned by women.
RESULTS: About one in three women was not informed of any danger sign. For most
danger signs, fewer than half of the women were counselled. Vaginal bleeding and 
severe abdominal pain were the signs most counselled on (between 52% and 66%). At
study facilities in Burkina Faso, 58% of the pregnant women were not able to
mention a danger sign, in Ghana this was 22% and in Tanzania 30%. Fever, vaginal 
bleeding and severe abdominal pain were the danger signs most frequently
mentioned. The type of health worker (depending on the training they received)
was significantly associated with counselling practices. Depending on the study
site, characteristics significantly associated with awareness of signs were
women's age, gestational age, gravidity and educational level.
CONCLUSION: Counselling practice is poor and not very efficient. A new approach
of informing pregnant women on danger signs is needed. However, as effects of
antenatal care education remain largely unknown, it is very well possible that
improved counselling will not affect maternal and newborn mortality and
morbidity.

Determinants of moderate-to-severe anaemia among women of reproductive age in
Tanzania: analysis of data from the 2010 Tanzania demographic and health survey.

Wilunda C, Massawe S, Jackson C.

Projects Department, Doctors with Africa CUAMM, Padua, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of moderate-to-severe anaemia among women of 
reproductive age in Tanzania.
METHODS: We included participants from the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health
Survey, which collected data on socio-demographic and maternal health and
determined haemoglobin levels from blood samples. We performed logistic
regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios for associations between
socio-demographic, contextual, reproductive and lifestyle factors, and
moderate-to-severe anaemia and investigated interactions between certain risk
factors.
RESULTS: Of 9477 women, 20.1% were anaemic. Pregnancy was significantly
associated with anaemia (adjusted OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.43-2.15), but the effect
varied significantly by urban/rural residence, wealth and education. The effect
of pregnancy was stronger in women without education and those who were in lower 
wealth groups, with significant interactions observed for each of these factors. 
Education was associated with a lower anaemia risk, particularly in the poorest
group (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.80), and in pregnant women. The risk of anaemia
fell with rising iron supplementation coverage. Lack of toilet facilities
increased anaemia risk (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00-1.60), whereas using hormonal
contraception reduced it. There was no association with age, urban/rural
residence, wealth or type of cooking fuel in adjusted analysis.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women in Tanzania are particularly at risk of
moderate-to-severe anaemia, with the effect modified by urban/rural residence,
education and wealth. Prevention interventions should target women with lower
education or without proper sanitation facilities, and women who are pregnant,
particularly if they are uneducated or in lower wealth groups.

The Contribution of Preterm Birth and Intrauterine Growth Restriction to Infant
Mortality in Tanzania.

Sania A, Spiegelman D, Rich-Edwards J, Okuma J, Kisenge R, Msamanga G, Urassa W, 
Fawzi WW.

Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA.

BACKGROUND: Our objectives were to examine the associations of neonatal and
infant mortality with preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR),
and to estimate the partial population attributable risk per cent (pPAR%) of
neonatal and infant mortality due to preterm birth and IUGR.
METHODS: Participants were HIV-negative pregnant women and their infants enrolled
in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Gestational age calculated from date of last
menstrual period was used to define preterm, and small for gestational age (SGA) 
was used as proxy for IUGR. Survival of infants was ascertained at monthly
follow-up visits. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the
associations of preterm and SGA with neonatal and infant mortality.
RESULTS: Study included 7225 singletons, of whom 15% were preterm and 21% were
SGA; majority of preterm or SGA babies had birthweight â‰¥2500â€‰g. Compared to term 
and appropriately sized babies (AGA), relative risks (RR) of neonatal mortality
among preterm-AGA was 2.6 [95% CI 1.8, 3.9], RR among term-SGA was 2.3 [95% CI
1.6, 3.3], and the highest risk was among the preterm-SGA babies (RR 15.1 [95% CI
8.2, 27.7]). Risk associated with preterm was elevated throughout the infancy,
and risk associated with SGA was elevated during the neonatal period only. The
pPAR% of neonatal mortality for preterm was 22% [95% CI 17%, 26%] and for SGA it 
was 26% [95% CI 16%, 36%].
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm and SGA birth substantially increased the risk of mortality.
Interventions for prevention and management of these conditions are likely to
reduce of infant mortality in Tanzania.

Clinical features, proximate causes, and consequences of active convulsive
epilepsy in Africa.

Centre for Geographic Medicine Research Coast, Kenya Medical Research Institute, 
Kilifi, Kenya; Studies of Epidemiology of Epilepsy in Demographic Surveillance
Systems (SEEDS)-INDEPTH Network, Accra, Ghana; Department of Psychiatry,
University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.

PURPOSE: Epilepsy is common in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but the clinical
features and consequences are poorly characterized. Most studies are
hospital-based, and few studies have compared different ecological sites in SSA. 
We described active convulsive epilepsy (ACE) identified in cross-sectional
community-based surveys in SSA, to understand the proximate causes, features, and
consequences.
METHODS: We performed a detailed clinical and neurophysiologic description of ACE
cases identified from a community survey of 584,586 people using medical history,
neurologic examination, and electroencephalography (EEG) data from five sites in 
Africa: South Africa; Tanzania; Uganda; Kenya; and Ghana. The cases were examined
by clinicians to discover risk factors, clinical features, and consequences of
epilepsy. We used logistic regression to determine the epilepsy factors
associated with medical comorbidities.
KEY FINDINGS: Half (51%) of the 2,170 people with ACE were children and 69% of
seizures began in childhood. Focal features (EEG, seizure types, and neurologic
deficits) were present in 58% of ACE cases, and these varied significantly with
site. Status epilepticus occurred in 25% of people with ACE. Only 36% received
antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital was the most common drug [95%]), and the
proportion varied significantly with the site. Proximate causes of ACE were
adverse perinatal events (11%) for onset of seizures before 18Â years; and acute
encephalopathy (10%) and head injury prior to seizure onset (3%). Important
comorbidities were malnutrition (15%), cognitive impairment (23%), and neurologic
deficits (15%). The consequences of ACE were burns (16%), head injuries
(postseizure) (1%), lack of education (43%), and being unmarried (67%) or
unemployed (57%) in adults, all significantly more common than in those without
epilepsy.
SIGNIFICANCE: There were significant differences in the comorbidities across
sites. Focal features are common in ACE, suggesting identifiable and preventable 
causes. Malnutrition and cognitive and neurologic deficits are common in people
with ACE and should be integrated into the management of epilepsy in this region.
Consequences of epilepsy such as burns, lack of education, poor marriage
prospects, and unemployment need to be addressed.

Large vesico-vaginal fistula caused by a foreign body.

Massinde A, Kihunrwa A.

Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Bugando Medical Centre Box 1370, Mwanza 
and Catholic University of Health Science and Allied Sciences, Box 1464, Mwanza, 
Tanzania.

Foreign body is a rare cause of vesico-vaginal fistula most often reported in
developed countries. In developing countries obstructed labor is the commonest
cause of fistula. A nulliparous 19-year-old female presented with a 3-week
history of a foreign body in the vagina causing urinary incontinence and
offensive vaginal discharge. Her guardian allegedly inserted the foreign body
after she refused a pre-arranged marriage. A plastic container was removed from
the vagina under general anesthesia. A large vesico-vaginal fistula was
discovered, which was successfully surgically repaired. We recommend urgent
removal of the foreign body, preferably under general anesthesia. However, if the
history or physical examination reveals prolonged exposure, repair of the fistula
should be delayed to allow for adequate debridement in order to prevent any
life-threatening complications.

The Effect of Depressive Symptoms and CD4 Count on Adherence to Highly Active
Antiretroviral Therapy in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Memiah P, Shumba C, Etienne-Mesubi M, Agbor S, Hossain MB, Komba P, Niyang M,
Biadgilign S.

Baltimore, MD, USA.

Background:Studies have identified several programmatic and nonprogrammatic
indicators that affect adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Depression has been shown to impact adherence to HAART. This cross-sectional
analysis of data collected from Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania in 2008
examined the relationship between levels of depressive symptoms, clinical
progression, and adherence to HAART.Methods:A multinational, multicenter,
observational, retrospective cross-sectional evaluation of a population of focus 
comprised randomly selected patients on HAART. The dependent variable was
adherence to HAART. The primary variable of interest to be assessed was patients'
level of depressive symptom score. A multivariable logistic regression model was 
used to examine the relationship between explanatory variables and adherence to
HAART.Results:A total of 2344 patients were recruited for adherence survey. About
70% of the study sample reported having some level of depression. Logistic
regression results show that patients who reported, respectively, low, moderate, 
and high levels of depressive symptoms are 35% (P < .001), 56% (P < .001), and
64% (P < .001) less likely to adhere to HAART than those who reported having no
depressive symptoms. At multivariate analysis, adherence to HAART was
independently associated with the levels of depressive symptoms, older age, CD4
count >200 cells/mm(3), Truvada (tenofovir [TDF]/emtricitabine [FTC])-based
regimens, good knowledge about HAART, and longer period on
therapy.Conclusions:These results indicate that mental health and clinical
parameters are significant factors in determining patients' adherence to their
HAART, which need to be more aggressively addressed as a critical component of
care and treatment support.

Sources of community health worker motivation: a qualitative study in Morogoro
Region, Tanzania.

Greenspan JA, McMahon SA, Chebet JJ, Mpunga M, Urassa DP, Winch PJ.

BACKGROUND: There is a renewed interest in community health workers (CHWs) in
Tanzania, but also a concern that low motivation of CHWs may decrease the
benefits of investments in CHW programs. This study aimed to explore sources of
CHW motivation to inform programs in Tanzania and similar contexts.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 CHWs in Morogoro Region,
Tanzania. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and coded prior to
translation and thematic analysis. The authors then conducted a literature review
on CHW motivation and a framework that aligned with our findings was modified to 
guide the presentation of results.
RESULTS: Sources of CHW motivation were identified at the individual, family,
community, and organizational levels. At the individual level, CHWs are
predisposed to volunteer work and apply knowledge gained to their own problems
and those of their families and communities. Families and communities supplement 
other sources of motivation by providing moral, financial, and material support, 
including service fees, supplies, money for transportation, and help with farm
work and CHW tasks. Resistance to CHW work exhibited by families and community
members is limited. The organizational level (the government and its development 
partners) provides motivation in the form of stipends, potential employment,
materials, training, and supervision, but inadequate remuneration and supplies
discourage CHWs. Supervision can also be dis-incentivizing if perceived as a sign
of poor performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Tanzanian CHWs who work despite not receiving a salary have an
intrinsic desire to volunteer, and their motivation often derives from support
received from their families when other sources of motivation are insufficient.
Policy-makers and program managers should consider the burden that a lack of
remuneration imposes on the families of CHWs. In addition, CHWs' intrinsic desire
to volunteer does not preclude a desire for external rewards. Rather, adequate
and formal financial incentives and in-kind alternatives would allow
already-motivated CHWs to increase their commitment to their work.

Acute schistosomiasis in European students returning from fieldwork at lake
tanganyika, Tanzania.

Steiner F, Ignatius R, Friedrich-Jaenicke B, Dieckmann S, Harms G, Poppert S,
Mockenhaupt FP.

Institute of Tropical Medicine and International Health,
Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is common in many African regions and poses a risk
for travelers and the local population. So far, schistosomiasis in travelers or
expatriates returning from the Tanzanian bank of Lake Tanganyika has not been
reported.
METHODS: We report a group of students who sought treatment with signs of acute
schistosomiasis after having returned from Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania. Information
as to travel and exposure as well as clinical and laboratory data were collected.
RESULTS: Schistosomiasis was diagnosed in 8 of 16 students from Berlin, Germany, 
who had returned from a 2- to 3-month stay of fieldwork in Kigoma District at
Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania. All 16 students reported frequent freshwater exposure 
at the lake. Six patients showed signs of acute schistosomiasis and had fever,
and some of them also had cough, weakness, headache, or abdominal pain.
Eosinophilia was present in five of the six symptomatic individuals. Notably, two
serologically enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive individuals did 
not report or present with symptoms or abnormal laboratory parameters.
Schistosoma mansoni eggs were found in one symptomatic and one asymptomatic
individual each. Blood and stool samples from the other eight individuals who
were equally exposed to freshwater yielded negative results.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an outbreak of acute schistosomiasis
imported from the Tanzanian shore of Lake Tanganyika and highlights the risk for 
travelers and the local population of acquiring the infection in that part of
Tanzania. It provides arguments for routine serological screening for
schistosomiasis in individuals who had prior freshwater contact in endemic areas,
irrespective of symptoms or other laboratory findings.

Prevalence and predictors of exclusive breastfeeding among women in Kilimanjaro
region, Northern Tanzania: a population based cross-sectional study.

Mgongo M, Mosha MV, Uriyo JG, Msuya SE, Stray-Pedersen B.

BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is a simple and cost-effective
intervention to improve child health and survival. Effective EBF has been
estimated to avert 13% - 15% of under-five mortality and contribute to reduce
mother to child transmission of HIV. The prevalence of EBF for infant less than
six months is low in most developing countries, including Tanzania (50%). While
the Tanzania Demographic Health Survey collects information on overall EBF
prevalence, it does not evaluate factors influencing EBF. The aim of this paper
was to determine the prevalence and predictors of exclusive breastfeeding in
urban and rural areas in Kilimanjaro region.
METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2010
to March 2011 among women with infants aged 6--12 months in Kilimanjaro.
Multi-stage proportionate to size sampling was used to select participants from
all the seven districts of the region. A standardized questionnaire was used to
collect socio-demographic, reproductive, alcohol intake, breastfeeding patterns
and nutritional data during the interviews. Estimation on EBF was based on recall
since birth. Multivariable logistic regression was used to obtain independent
predictors of EBF.
RESULTS: A total of 624 women participated, 77% (483) from rural areas. The
prevalence of EBF up to six months in Kilimanjaro region was 20.7%, without
significant differences in the prevalence of EBF up to six months between urban
(22.7%) and rural areas (20.1%); (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5,1.4).In multivariable
analysis, advice on breastfeeding after delivery (Adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 2.6,
95% CI 1.5, 4.6) was positively associated with EBF up to six months. Compared to
married/cohabiting and those who do not take alcohol, single mothers (AOR = 0.4, 
95% CI 0.2, 0.9) and mothers who drank alcohol (AOR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.3, 0.7) had
less odds to practice EBF up to six months.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of EBF up to six months is still low in Kilimanjaro, lower
than the national coverage of 50%. Strengthening of EBF counseling in all
reproductive and child health clinics especially during antenatal and postnatal
periods may help to improve EBF rates.

Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.

Background:We assembled a prospective cohort of 3144 children less than 15 years 
of age initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania.Methods:The relationships of nutritional status and other baseline
characteristics in relation to mortality were examined using Cox proportional
hazards model.Results:Compared with children with weight for age (WAZ) > -1,
those with WAZ â‰¤ -2 to < -3 had a nearly double risk of death (relative risk
[RR], 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-3.11), and among those with WAZ â‰¤ 
-3, the risk more than tripled (RR, 3.36; 95% CI, 2.12-5.32). Other baseline risk
factors for overall mortality included severe anemia (P < .001), severe immune
suppression (P = .02), history of tuberculosis (P = .01), opportunistic
infections (P < .001), living in the poorest district (P < .001), and advanced
World Health Organization stage (P = .003).Conclusions:To sustain the obtained
benefit of ART in this setting, interventions to improve nutritional status may
be used as an adjunct to ART.

Comparing actual and perceived causes of fever among community members in a low
malaria transmission setting in northern Tanzania.

Hertz JT, Munishi OM, Sharp JP, Reddy EA, Crump JA.

Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, Duke University Medical
Center, Durham, NC, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To compare actual and perceived causes of fever in northern Tanzania.
METHODS: In a standardised survey, heads of households in 30 wards in Moshi,
Tanzania, were asked to identify the most common cause of fever for children and 
for adults. Responses were compared to data from a local hospital-based fever
aetiology study that used standard diagnostic techniques.
RESULTS: Of 810 interviewees, the median (range) age was 48 (16, 102) years and
509 (62.8%) were women. Malaria was the most frequently identified cause of
fever, cited by 353 (43.6%) and 459 (56.7%) as the most common cause of fever for
children and adults, respectively. In contrast, malaria accounted for 8 (2.0%) of
adult and 6 (1.3%) of paediatric febrile admissions in the fever aetiology study.
Weather was the second most frequently cited cause of fever. Participants who
identified a non-biomedical explanation such as weather as the most common cause 
of fever were more likely to prefer a traditional healer for treatment of febrile
adults (OR 2.7, PÂ <Â 0.001). Bacterial zoonoses were the most common cause of
fever among inpatients, but no interviewees identified infections from animal
contact as the most common cause of fever for adults; two (0.2%) identified these
infections as the most common cause of fever for children.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria is perceived to be a much more common cause of fever than
hospital studies indicate, whereas other important diseases are under-appreciated
in northern Tanzania. Belief in non-biomedical explanations of fever is common
locally and has important public health consequences.

Dynamics of Parent-Adolescent Communication on Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS in
Tanzania.

Communication between parents and their adolescent children has been identified
as one of the potential protective factors for adolescent sexual health.
Qualitative exploration of sexual health communication with adolescents aged
12-15 (N = 114) and a sub-group of the parents (N = 20) was carried out. Four
major themes emerged: reasons for parent-adolescent communications, or lack
thereof; the focus of parental messages; the moral of the message; and the
barriers to communication between parents and adolescents. Findings revealed
similarities and discrepancies in views and perceptions between parents and
adolescents. Adolescents and parents suggested that some sexual health
communication was happening. Parents were reportedly likely to use fear to ensure
that their children do not engage in risky sexual activities, while adolescents
reported that conversations with their parents were mostly ambiguous and filled
with warnings about the dangers of HIV/AIDS. Several communication barriers were 
reported by parents and adolescents. Parents of adolescents would benefit from
HIV/AIDS specific communication skills.

Predominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae ST14 carrying CTX-M-15 causing neonatal
sepsis in Tanzania.

Mshana SE, Hain T, Domann E, Lyamuya EF, Chakraborty T, Imirzalioglu C.

BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae strains expressing ESBLs are a predominant
cause of hospital acquired infections. Here we describe the molecular
epidemiology of these isolates in a tertiary hospital in Tanzania, as potential
pathogens for neonatal infections.
METHODS: Between April 2009 and March 2010 all Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates
with phenotypic expression Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) were collected
and characterized. Identification was done using in house biochemical tests in
case of ambiguous results confirmation was done using API 20E. Susceptibility
testing was determined using the disc diffusion method followed by specific PCR
and sequencing to determine ESBL genes. Phylogenetic analysis, Pulse field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multi-Locus sequence typing (MLST) to PFGE clusters
representative isolates were performed to determine clones of the isolates.
Conjugation and hybridization were performed to determine the location of
blaCTX-M-15 gene.
RESULTS: A total of 92 non- repetitive ESBL producing K. pneumoniae representing 
50.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were characterized. These isolates were
from blood 61 (66%), wound swab 13 (14%), urine 12 (13%) and pus 6 (7%) were
analyzed. Most blood culture strains originated from neonatal unit 39/61(64%) and
22 (36%) of the blood culture isolates were from neonatal ICU. All isolates were 
resistant to gentamicin and 54% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Using a
similarity index of 80%, the isolates were assigned to thirteen clusters based on
PFGE patterns and contained sub-clusters with identical strains indicating clonal
outbreaks. Cluster X5, X7 and X8, and X9 were grouped into ST48, ST14 and ST348
respectively. Based on gyrA PCR- RFLP phylogenetic analysis all isolates were
grouped as KpI. The predominant ESBL allele detected was blaCTX-M-15 which was
found in 76 % of isolates, followed by blaTEM-104 (19 %), blaSHV-11 (3.2%) and
blaTEM-176 (2%). The blaCTX-M-15 gene was located in multiple conjugative IncF
plasmids ranging from 25kb-485kb in size.
CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of blaCTX-M-15 observed among ESBL producing K.
pneumoniae in Tanzania, is possibly due to the spread of a common IncFII 145kb
plasmid and of certain clones such as ST14 and ST48. Furthermore the 485kb
plasmid detected is the largest plasmid reported to carry blaCTX-M-15 todate.

Food Insecurity, Socioeconomic Status, and HIV-Related Risk Behavior Among Women 
in Farming Households in Tanzania.

Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, 1918
University Avenue, Suite 3B, Berkeley, CA, 94704, USA, smccoy@berkeley.edu.

Food insecurity (FI) is associated with higher-risk sexual behavior in some
studies. However, the overlap between FI and socioeconomic status (SES) has been 
poorly described. The study objectives were to: (1) determine the relationship
between household FI and four dimensions of SES among sexually active Tanzanian
women in farming households: expenditures, assets, flooring material of the home,
and land ownership; and (2) determine whether FI is associated with higher-risk
sexual behavior and relationship power. In male-headed households, FI was
associated with assets, flooring material, and land ownership but not
expenditures. There was no association between FI and the four dimensions of SES 
in female-headed households. Among women in male-headed households, but not
female household heads themselves, severe FI was associated with a
non-significant increase in the likelihood of being in a relationship because of 
material goods [adjusted prevalence ratio (PRa) = 1.76, 95 % confidence interval 
(CI) 0.81, 3.81] and was inversely associated with being able to ask partners to 
use condoms (PRa = 0.47, 95 % CI 0.25, 0.88). There was not a strong association 
between food security and relationship power. Our findings suggest that the
association between FI and HIV risk behavior may differ depending on the type of 
household.

Center for Global Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of
Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate promoters and barriers for cervical cancer screening in
rural Tanzania.
METHODS: We interviewed 300 women of reproductive age living in Kiwangwa village,
Tanzania. The odds of attending a free, 2-day screening service were compared
with sociodemographic variables, lifestyle factors, and knowledge and attitudes
surrounding cervical cancer using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Compared with women who did not attend the screening service (n=195),
women who attended (n=105) were older (OR 4.29; 95% CI, 1.61-11.48, age
40-49years versus 20-29years), listened regularly to the radio (OR 24.76; 95% CI,
11.49-53.33, listened to radio 1-3 times per week versus not at all), had a
poorer quality of life (OR 4.91; CI, 1.96-12.32, lowest versus highest score),
had faced cost barriers to obtaining health care in the preceding year (OR 2.24; 
95% CI, 1.11-4.53, yes versus no), and held a more positive attitude toward
cervical cancer screening (OR 4.64; 95% CI, 1.39-15.55, least versus most
averse).
CONCLUSION: Efforts aimed at improving screening rates in rural Tanzania need to 
address both structural and individual-level barriers, including knowledge and
awareness of cervical cancer prevention, cost barriers to care, and access to
health information.

Prevalence and determinants of obesity among primary school children in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.

Muhihi AJ, Mpembeni RN, Njelekela MA, Anaeli A, Chillo O, Kubhoja S, Lujani B,
Maghembe M, Ngarashi D.

BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has increased dramatically and has become a public 
health concern worldwide. Childhood obesity is likely to persist through
adulthood and may lead to early onset of NCDs. However, there is paucity of data 
on obesity among primary school children in Tanzania. This study assessed the
prevalence and determinants of obesity among primary school children in Dar es
Salaam.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among school age children in
randomly selected schools in Dar es Salaam. Anthropometric and blood pressure
measurements were taken using standard procedures. Body Mass Index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters
(kg/m2). Child obesity was defined as BMI at or above 95th percentile for age and
sex. Socio-demographic characteristics of children were determined using a
structured questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to determine association
between independent variables with obesity among primary school children in Dar
es Salaam.
RESULTS: A total of 446 children were included in the analysis. The mean age of
the participants was 11.1+/-2.0 years and 53.1% were girls. The mean BMI, SBP and
DBP were 16.6+/-4.0 kg/m2, 103.9+/-10.3mmHg and 65.6+/-8.2mmHg respectively. The 
overall prevalence of child obesity was 5.2% and was higher among girls (6.3%)
compared to boys (3.8%). Obese children had significantly higher mean values for 
age (p=0.042), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (all p<0.001). Most obese
children were from households with fewer children (p=0.019) and residing in urban
areas (p=0.002). Controlling for other variables, age above 10 years (AOR=3.3,
95% CI=1.5-7.2), female sex (AOR=2.6, 95% CI=1.4-4.9), urban residence (AOR=2.5, 
95% CI=1.2-5.3) and having money to spend at school (AOR=2.6, 95% CI=1.4-4.8)
were significantly associated with child obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of childhood obesity in this population was found to 
be low. However, children from urban schools and girls were proportionately more 
obese compared to their counterparts. Primary preventive measures for childhood
obesity should start early in childhood and address socioeconomic factors of
parents contributing to childhood obesity.

Endoscopic and clinicopathological patterns of esophageal cancer in Tanzania:
experiences from two tertiary health institutions.

McHembe MD, Rambau PF, Chalya PL, Jaka H, Koy M, Mahalu W.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer is one of the most serious gastrointestinal cancer 
worldwide, owing to its rapid development and fatal prognoses in most cases.
There is a paucity of published data regarding esophageal cancer in Tanzania and 
the study area in particular. This study was conducted to describe the endoscopic
and clinicopathological patterns of esophageal cancer in this part of the world. 
The study provides baseline local data for future comparison.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of histologically confirmed cases of
esophageal cancer seen at Bugando Medical Center and Muhimbili National Hospital 
between March 2008 and February 2013. Data were retrieved from medical record
computer database and analyzed using SPSS computer software version 17.0.
RESULTS: A total of 328 esophageal cancer patients were enrolled in the study,
representing 25.3% of all malignant gastrointestinal tract tumors. The male to
female ratio was 2.2:1. The median age of patients at presentation was 47 years. 
The majority of patients (86.6%) were peasants coming from the rural areas.
Smoking and alcohol consumption were documented in 74.7% and 61.6% of patients
respectively. Family history of esophageal cancer was reported in 4.6% of cases. 
The majority of patients (81.7%) presented late with advanced stage of cancer.
Progressive dysphagia and weight loss were the most common presenting symptoms
occurring in all patients. The middle third esophagus (58.5%) was the most
frequent anatomical site for esophageal cancer followed by lower third (27.4%)
and upper third esophagus (10.4%). Squamous cell carcinoma (96.0%) was the most
common histopathological type. Adenocarcinoma occurred in 13 (4.0%) patients. TNM
staging was documented in only 104 (31.7%) patients. Of these, 102(98.1%)
patients were diagnosed with advanced esophageal cancer (Stages III and IV).
According to tumor grading, most of tumors were moderately differentiated
accounting for 56.1% of cases. Distant metastasis was documented in 43.3% of
patients.
CONCLUSION: Esophageal cancer is not uncommon in this region and shows a trend
towards a relative young age at presentation and the majority of patients present
late with advanced stage. There is a need for screening of high-risk populations 
and detecting esophageal cancer at an early stage in order to improve chances for
successful treatment and survival.

Micronutrient supplementation and T cell-mediated immune responses in patients
with tuberculosis in Tanzania.

Kawai K, Meydani SN, Urassa W, Wu D, Mugusi FM, Saathoff E, Bosch RJ, Villamor E,
Spiegelman D, Fawzi WW.

Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.

SUMMARY Limited studies exist regarding whether incorporating micronutrient
supplements during tuberculosis (TB) treatment may improve cell-mediated immune
response. We examined the effect of micronutrient supplementation on lymphocyte
proliferation response to mycobacteria or T-cell mitogens in a randomized trial
conducted on 423 patients with pulmonary TB. Eligible participants were randomly 
assigned to receive a daily dose of micronutrients (vitamins A, B-complex, C, E, 
and selenium) or placebo at the time of initiation of TB treatment. We found no
overall effect of micronutrient supplements on lymphocyte proliferative responses
to phytohaemagglutinin or purified protein derivatives in HIV-negative and
HIV-positive TB patients. Of HIV-negative TB patients, the micronutrient group
tended to show higher proliferative responses to concanavalin A than the placebo 
group, although the clinical relevance of this finding is not readily notable.
The role of nutritional intervention in this vulnerable population remains an
important area of future research.

The present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of ultraviolet
radiations (UV-C) on the fatty acids composition of three serovars of Salmonella:
S. typhimurium, S. hadar and S. zanzibar. Results obtained show that UV-C
treatment increases significantly (PÂ â‰¤Â 0.05) the percentage of cyclic fatty
acids. The atomic force microscopy was used to study the morphology and cell
surface of irradiated strains. Results show that UV-C rays induce morphological
changes and alter the bacterial cell surface (presence of grooves and
irregularities).

From crossbreeding to biotechnology-facilitated improvement of banana and
plantain.

Ortiz R, Swennen R.

Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Department of Plant Breeding, 
Sundsvagen 14, Box 101, 23053 Alnarp, Sweden. Electronic address:
rodomiro.ortiz@slu.se.

The annual harvest of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) is approximately
145milliontons worldwide. About 85% of this global production comes from small
plots and kitchen or backyard gardens from the developing world, and only 15%
goes to the export trade. Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana are the ancestors of
several hundreds of parthenocarpic Musa diploid and polyploid cultivars, which
show multiple origins through inter- and intra-specific hybridizations from these
two wild diploid species. Generating hybrids combining host plant resistance to
pathogens and pests, short growth cycles and height, high fruit yield,
parthenocarpy, and desired quality from the cultivars remains a challenge for
Musa crossbreeding, which started about one century ago in Trinidad. The success 
of Musa crossbreeding depends on the production of true hybrid seeds in a crop
known for its high levels of female sterility, particularly among polyploid
cultivars. All banana export cultivars grown today are, however, selections from 
somatic mutants of the group Cavendish and have a very narrow genetic base, while
smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Asia and Latin America use some
bred-hybrids (mostly cooking types). Musa improvement goals need to shift to
address emerging threats because of the changing climate. Innovative cell and
molecular biology tools have the potential to enhance the pace and efficiency of 
genetic improvement in Musa. Micro-propagation has been successful for high
throughput of clean planting materials while in vitro seed germination assists in
obtaining seedlings after inter-specific and across ploidy hybridization. Flow
cytometry protocols are used for checking ploidy among genebank accessions and
breeding materials. DNA markers, the genetic maps based on them, and the recent
sequencing of the banana genome offer means for gaining more insights in the
genetics of the crops and to identifying genes that could lead to accelerating
Musa betterment. Likewise, DNA fingerprinting has been useful to characterize
Musa diversity. Genetic engineering provides a complementary tool to Musa
breeders who can introduce today transgenes that may confer resistance to
bacteria, fungi and nematodes, or enhance pro-vitamin A fruit content. In spite
of recent advances, the genetic improvement of Musa depends on a few
crossbreeding programs (based in Brazil, Cameroon, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Guadeloupe,
Honduras, India, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda) or a handful of genetic
engineering endeavors (Australia, Belgium, India, Kenya, Malaysia and Uganda).
Development investors (namely international aid and philanthropy) should
therefore increase their funding to genetically enhance this crop that ranks
among the 10-top staple foods of the developing world.

Early infant diagnosis of HIV in three regions in Tanzania; successes and
challenges.

Chiduo MG, Mmbando BP, Theilgaard ZP, Bygbjerg IC, Gerstoft J, Lemnge M,
Katzenstein TL.

BACKGROUND: By the end of 2009 an estimated 2.5 million children worldwide were
living with HIV-1, mostly as a consequence of vertical transmission, and more
than 90% of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2008 the World Health
Organization (WHO), recommended early initiation of Highly Active Antiretroviral 
Therapy (HAART) to all HIV infected infants diagnosed within the first year of
life, and since 2010, within the first two years of life, irrespective of CD4
count or WHO clinical stage. The study aims were to describe implementation of
EID programs in three Tanzanian regions with differences in HIV prevalences and
logistical set-up with regard to HIV DNA testing.
METHODS: Data were obtained by review of the prevention from mother to child
transmission of HIV (PMTCT) registers from 2009--2011 at the Reproductive and
Child Health Clinics (RCH) and from the databases from the Care and Treatment
Clinics (CTC) in all the three regions; Kilimanjaro, Mbeya and Tanga. Statistical
tests used were Poisson regression model and rank sum test.
RESULTS: During the period of 2009 -- 2011 a total of 4,860 exposed infants were 
registered from the reviewed sites, of whom 4,292 (88.3%) were screened for HIV
infection. Overall proportion of tested infants in the three regions increased
from 77.2% in 2009 to 97.8% in 2011. A total of 452 (10.5%) were found to be HIV 
infected (judged by the result of the first test). The prevalence of HIV
infection among infants was higher in Mbeya when compared to Kilimanjaro region
RR = 1.872 (95% CI = 1.408 -- 2.543) p < 0.001. However sample turnaround time
was significantly shorter in both Mbeya (2.7 weeks) and Tanga (5.0 weeks) as
compared to Kilimanjaro (7.0 weeks), p < 0,001. A substantial of loss to
follow-up (LTFU) was evident at all stages of EID services in the period of 2009 
to 2011. Among the infants who were receiving treatment, 61% were found to be
LFTU during the review period.
CONCLUSION: The study showed an increase in testing of HIV exposed infants within
the three years, there is large variations of HIV prevalence among the regions.
Challenges like; sample turnaround time and LTFU must be overcome before this can
translate into the intended goal of early initiation of lifelong lifesaving
antiretroviral therapy for the infants.

Assessment of HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes and behaviours among students in
higher education in Tanzania.

Mkumbo K.

a Faculty of Education , Dar es Salaam University College of Education , Dar es
Salaam , Tanzania.

There is a paucity of studies that have systematically and comprehensively
investigated the knowledge level, attitudes and the pattern of sexual behaviours 
related to HIV and AIDS in higher education settings in sub-Saharan Africa in
general and Tanzania in particular. This study attempted to fill a void in
knowledge. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used, employing a
self-administered questionnaire as the main data collection tool. More than 400
higher education students completed a questionnaire assessing their knowledge,
attitudes and behaviours related to HIV and AIDS. About three quarters of
respondents demonstrated comprehensive knowledge about HIV and AIDS, and the
majority of respondents expressed positive attitudes towards people living with
HIV and AIDS. Despite demonstrating high knowledge level about HIV and AIDS, the 
results show that sexual behaviours among students in higher education are
characteristically risky, and do not significantly differ from youth in the
general population.

A new archosauriform (reptilia: diapsida) from the manda beds (middle triassic)
of southwestern Tanzania.

Nesbitt SJ, Butler RJ, Gower DJ.

Burke Museum and Department of Biology, University of Washington, Seattle,
Washington, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: Archosauria and their closest relatives, the non-archosaurian
archosauriforms, diversified in the Early and Middle Triassic, soon after the
end-Permian extinction. This diversification is poorly documented in most Lower
and Middle Triassic rock sequences because fossils of early groups of
archosauriforms are relatively rare compared to those of other amniotes. The
early Middle Triassic (? late Anisian) Manda beds of southwestern Tanzania form
an exception, with early archosaur skeletons being relatively common and
preserved as articulated or associated specimens. The Manda archosaur assemblage 
is exceptionally diverse for the Middle Triassic. However, to date, no
non-archosaurian archosauriforms have been reported from these rocks.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we name a new taxon, Asperoris mnyama gen. 
et sp. nov., from the Manda beds and thoroughly describe the only known specimen.
The specimen consists of a well-preserved partial skull including tooth-bearing
elements (premaxilla, maxilla), the nasal, partial skull roof, and several
incomplete elements. All skull elements are covered in an autapomorphic highly
rugose sculpturing. A unique combination of character states indicates that A.
mnyama lies just outside Archosauria as a stem archosaur within Archosauriformes,
but more precise relationships of A. mnyama relative to other early
archosauriform clades (e.g., Erythrosuchidae) cannot be determined currently.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Asperoris mnyama is the first confirmed
non-archosaurian archosauriform from the Manda beds and increases the
morphological and taxonomic diversity of early archosauriforms known from the
Middle Triassic. The direct association of A. mnyama with species referable to
Archosauria demonstrates that non-archosaurian archosauriforms were present
during the rise and early diversification of Archosauria. Non-archosaurian
archosauriforms and archosaurs co-occur in fossil reptile assemblages across
Pangaea from the late Early Triassic to the end of the Late Triassic.

Wild foods from farm and forest in the East usambara mountains, Tanzania.

Powell B, Maundu P, Kuhnlein HV, Johns T.

a School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition and the Centre for Indigenous Peoples' 
Nutrition and Environment , McGill University , Montreal , Quebec , Canada.

This study explored the role of wild foods in the diets of children and mothers
in the East Usambara Mountains (Nâ€‰=â€‰274 dyads). We identified 92 wild food
species. Although dietary diversity (most measures) was not different between
seasons, wild foods accounted for a greater percentage of items consumed in the
wet (food insecure) season. Many wild foods were obtained on farm; wild foods
obtained from the forest accounted for less than 3% of food items consumed. Wild 
foods were used by virtually all informants but contributed only 2% of total
energy in the diet. However, they contributed large percentages of vitamin A
(RAE) (31%), vitamin C (20%), and iron (19.19%). Agricultural factors (e.g.,
hours spent in farm) were associated with greater wild food use. These findings
suggest participation in agriculture may be important for the maintenance of wild
food use, and that wild foods can play an important role in the nutritional
resilience of local people.

Domestic ruminants and Wild ungulates can act as reservoir hosts for
Mycobacterium bovis, causative agent for bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in animals and
man. Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is endemic in pastoral livestock in Tanzania.
There is lack of information on genotypic distribution of M.Â bovis in animals at 
wildlife-livestock interface areas and in wildlife conserved areas. The
objectives of this study were to characterize and determine the spatial
distribution of M.Â bovis isolates. Tissue samples from cattle and wildlife were
cultured and analyzed using deletion typing and spoligotyping techniques. Eight
(8.9%) M.Â bovis strains were isolated from cattle and confirmed by RD4 and RD9
polymerize chain reaction (PCR) assays. Spoligotype SB1467 was the dominant
pattern 62.5% (nÂ =Â 8) in infected animals, two isolates belonged to a newly
reported type SB2190, and one isolate belonged to SB0133. The spoligotype
patterns of SB1467 and SB0133 were closely related (96.9%) while SB2190 was less 
related (59.4%) to SB0133, the relatedness amongst spoligotypes were associated
with spacer position 15. No M.Â bovis was isolated from hunted wild animals. The
current study has identified a novel spoligotype SB2190. The current data suggest
that wild animals in Mikumi-Selous ecosystem are at risk of acquiring M.Â bovis
infection due to occasional interaction by sharing of pasture and water sources
between wildlife and livestock. Integrated efforts by all stakeholders are
crucial for controlling spread of tuberculosis at livestock/wildlife/human
interface areas.

Feasibility and coverage of implementing intermittent preventive treatment of
malaria in pregnant women contacting private or public clinics in Tanzania:
experience-based viewpoints of health managers in Mkuranga and Mufindi districts.

Mubyazi GM, Magnussen P, Byskov J, Bloch P.

BACKGROUND: Evidence on healthcare managers' experience on operational
feasibility of malaria intermittent preventive treatment for malaria during
pregnancy (IPTp) using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in Africa is
systematically inadequate. This paper elucidates the perspectives of District
Council Health Management Team (CHMT)s regarding the feasibility of IPTp with SP 
strategy, including its acceptability and ability of district health care systems
to cope with the contemporary and potential challenges.
METHODS: The study was conducted in Mkuranga and Mufindi districts. Data were
collected between November 2005 and December 2007, involving focus group
discussion (FGD) with Mufindi CHMT and in-depth interviews were conducted with
few CHMT members in Mkuranga where it was difficult to summon all members for
FGD.
RESULTS: Participants in both districts acknowledged the IPTp strategy,
considering the seriousness of malaria in pregnancy problem; government
allocation of funds to support healthcare staff training programmes in focused
antenatal care (fANC) issues, procuring essential drugs distributed to districts,
staff remuneration, distribution of fANC guidelines, and administrative
activities performed by CHMTs. The identified weaknesses include late arrival of 
funds from central level weakening CHMT's performance in health supervision,
organising outreach clinics, distributing essential supplies, and delivery of
IPTp services. Participants anticipated the public losing confidence in SP for
IPTp after government announced artemither-lumefantrine (ALu) as the new
first-line drug for uncomplicated malaria replacing SP. Role of private
healthcare staff in IPTp services was acknowledged cautiously because CHMTs
rarely supplied private clinics with SP for free delivery in fear that clients
would be required to pay for the SP contrary to government policy. In Mufindi,
the District Council showed a strong political support by supplementing ANC
clinics with bottled water; in Mkuranga such support was not experienced. A
combination of health facility understaffing, water scarcity and staff
non-adherence to directly observed therapy instructions forced healthcare staff
to allow clients to take SP at home. Need for investigating in improving
adherence to IPTp administration was emphasised.
CONCLUSION: High acceptability of the IPTp strategy at district level is
meaningless unless necessary support is assured in terms of number, skills and
motivation of caregivers and availability of essential supplies.

Estimated risk of HIV acquisition and practice for preventing occupational
exposure: a study of healthcare workers at Tumbi and Dodoma Hospitals, Tanzania.

Mashoto KO, Mubyazi GM, Makundi E, Mohamed H, Malebo HM.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of acquiring human
immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) and other infections via exposure to infectious
patients' blood and body fluids. The main objective of this study was to estimate
the risk of HIV transmission and examine the practices for preventing
occupational exposures among HCWs at Tumbi and Dodoma Hospitals in Tanzania.
METHODS: This study was carried out in two hospitals, namely, Tumbi in Coast
Region and Dodoma in Dodoma Region. In each facility, hospital records of
occupational exposure to HIV infection and its management were reviewed. In
addition, practices to prevent occupational exposure to HIV infection among HCWs 
were observed.
RESULTS: The estimated risk of HIV transmission due to needle stick injuries was 
calculated to be 7 cases per 1,000,000 HCWs-years. Over half of the observed
hospital departments did not have guidelines for prevention and management of
occupational exposure to HIV infections and lacked well displayed health and
safety instructions. Approximately, one-fifth of the hospital departments visited
failed to adhere to the instructions pertaining to correlation between waste
materials and the corresponding colour coded bag/container/safety box. Seventy
four percent of the hospital departments observed did not display instructions
for handling infectious materials. Inappropriate use of gloves, lack of health
and safety instructions, and lack of use of eye protective glasses were more
frequently observed at the Dodoma Hospital than at Tumbi Hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: The poor quality of the hospital records at the two hospitals
hampered our effort to characterise the risk of HIV infection acquisition by
HCWs. Greater data completeness in hospital records is needed to allow the
determination of the actual risk of HIV transmission for HCWs. To further reduce 
the risk of HIV infection due to occupational exposure, hospitals should be
equipped with sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and HCWs should be
reminded of the importance of adhering to universal precautions.

Usefulness of Plasmodium falciparum-specific rapid diagnostic tests for
assessment of parasite clearance and detection of recurrent infections after
artemisinin-based combination therapy.

Aydin-Schmidt B, Mubi M, Morris U, Petzold M, Ngasala BE, Premji Z, Björkman A,
Mårtensson A.

BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is an important tool for parasite-based
malaria diagnosis. High specificity of RDTs to distinguish an active Plasmodium
falciparum infection from residual antigens from a previous infection is crucial 
in endemic areas where residents are repeatedly exposed to malaria. The
efficiency of two RDTs based on histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) antigens were studied and compared with two microscopy
techniques (Giemsa and acridine orange-stained blood smears) and real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for assessment of initial clearance and detection
of recurrent P. falciparum infections after artemisinin-based combination therapy
(ACT) in a moderately high endemic area of rural Tanzania.
METHODS: In this exploratory study 53 children < five years with uncomplicated P.
falciparum malaria infection were followed up on nine occasions, i e, day 1, 2,
3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42, after initiation of artemether-lumefantrine
treatment. At each visit capillary blood samples was collected for the HRP2 and
LDH-based RDTs, Giemsa and acridine orange-stained blood smears for microscopy
and real-time PCR. Assessment of clearance times and detection of recurrent P.
falciparum infections were done for all diagnostic methods.
RESULTS: The median clearance times were 28 (range seven to >42) and seven (two
to 14) days for HRP2 and LDH-based RDTs, two (one to seven) and two (one to 14)
days for Giemsa and acridine orange-stained blood smear and two (one to 28) days 
for real-time PCR. RDT specificity against Giemsa-stained blood smear microscopy 
was 21% for HRP2 on day 14, reaching 87% on day 42, and >=96% from day 14 to 42
for LDH. There was no significant correlation between parasite density at
enrolment and duration of HRP2 positivity (r = 0.13, p = 0.34). Recurrent malaria
infections occurred in ten (19%) children. The HRP2 and LDH-based RDTs did not
detect eight and two of the recurrent infections, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The LDH-based RDT was superior to HRP2-based for monitoring of
treatment outcome and detection of recurrent infections after ACT in this
moderately high transmission setting. The results may have implications for the
choice of RDT devices in similar transmission settings for improved malaria case 
management.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01843764.

Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA cRwanda Biomedical Center,
Kigali, Rwanda.

OBJECTIVES:: To compare pre and post-ART attrition between youth (15-24 years)
and other patients in HIV care, and to investigate factors associated with
attrition among youth.
DESIGN:: Cohort study utilizing routinely collected patient-level data from 160
HIV clinics in Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Rwanda.
METHODS:: Patients at least 10 years of age enrolling in HIV care between 01/05
and 09/10 were included. Attrition (loss to follow-up or death 1 year after
enrollment or ART initiation) was compared between youth and other patients using
multivariate competing risk (pre-ART) and traditional (post-ART) Cox Proportional
Hazards methods accounting for within-clinic correlation. Among youth,
patient-level and clinic-level factors associated with attrition were similarly
assessed.
RESULTS:: 312â€Š335 patients at least 10 years of age enrolled in HIV care; 147â€Š936
(47%) initiated ART, 17% enrolling in care and 10% initiating ART were youth.
Attrition before and after ART initiation was substantially higher among youth
compared with other age groups. Among youth, nonpregnant women experienced lower 
pre-ART attrition than men (sHRâ€Š=â€Š0.90, 95% CI:0.86-0.94), while both pregnant
(AHRâ€Š=â€Š0.85, 95% CI:0.74-0.97) and nonpregnant (AHRâ€Š=â€Š0.79, 95% CI:0.73-0.86)
female youth experienced lower post-ART attrition than men. Youth attending
clinics providing sexual and reproductive health services including condoms
(AHRâ€Š=â€Š0.47, 95% CI:0.32-0.70) and clinics offering adolescent support groups
(AHRâ€Š=â€Š0.73, 95% CI:0.52-1.0) experienced significantly lower attrition after ART
initiation.
CONCLUSION:: Youth experienced substantially higher attrition before and after
ART initiation compared with younger adolescents and older adults.
Adolescent-friendly services were associated with reduced attrition among youth, 
particularly after ART initiation.

Why are pro-poor exemption policies in Tanzania better implemented in some
districts than in others?

Maluka SO.

BACKGROUND: Like other African countries, Tanzania has in recent years, been
implementing various exemptions and targeting programmes to protect and ensure
equitable access to health care by poorer segments of the population. A body of
evidence indicates that exemption policies, while potentially effective in
principle, are ineffective in implementation. However, there is evidence that
some districts, despite the challenges, perform better than others in terms of
identifying the poor and allocating funds for the poor and vulnerable groups.
METHODS: Drawing from the review of minutes, health facility visits, and key
informant interviews with the community representatives and the district health
managers, the study explored why exemption policies in Tanzania are relatively
better implemented in some districts than in others.
RESULTS: The findings indicate that in Lindi district the pro-poor exemption
mechanism was ineffective in implementation. There were no clear ways of
identifying and protecting the poor household members. In contrast, in Iramba
district the policy was relatively better implemented. The poor were identified
at the village, ward, health facility and district levels. In some villages, the 
poor were grouped in 10s to form one household. Then, using the village funds,
the Community Health Fund cards were purchased for them. Personal initiatives of 
the key district leaders, commitment of the district health management team and
local government officials, regular supervisory visits, as well as incentives to 
the health facility committees and boards were the main factors that facilitated 
the implementation of the pro-poor exemption policy.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded from this study that management and leadership
practices including personal initiatives of the key district leaders, effective
supervision mechanisms, commitment of the district health management team and
local government officials, as well as incentives for the health facility
committees and board members are pivotal for the implementation of the pro-poor
exemption policies.

Complications of childbirth and pregnancy are leading causes of death among women
of reproductive age. Developing countries account for 99% of maternal deaths. The
aim of this study was to explore levels, causes and risk factors associated with 
maternal mortality in rural Tanzania. Longitudinal data (2002-2006) from Rufiji
HDSS was used where a total of 26 427 women aged 15-49 years were included in the
study; 64 died and there were 15 548 live births. Cox proportional hazards
regression was used to assess the risk factors associated with maternal deaths.
MMR was 412 per 100 000 live births. The main causes of death were haemorrhage
(28%), eclampsia (19%) and puerperal sepsis (8%). An increased risk of 154% for
maternal death was found for women aged 30-39 versus 15-19 years (HR=2.54, 95%
CI=1.001-6.445). Married women had a protective effect of 62% over unmarried ones
(HR=0.38, 95% CI=0.176-0.839).

Communication, knowledge, social network and family planning utilization among
couples in Mwanza, Tanzania.

Mosha IH, Ruben R.

Behavioural Sciences Department, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied
Sciences, PO Box 65015, Dar es Salaam Tanzania. ihmosha@yahoo.co.uk

Family planning utilization in Tanzania is low. This study was cross sectional.
It examined family planning use and socio demographic variables, social networks,
knowledge and communication among the couples, whereby a stratified sample of 440
women of reproductive age (18-49), married or cohabiting was studied in Mwanza,
Tanzania. A structured questionnaire with questions on knowledge, communication
among the couples and practice of family planning was used. Descriptive
statistics and Logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with 
family planning (FP) use at four levels. The findings showed that majority
(73.2%) of respondents have not used family planning. Wealth was positive related
to FP use (p=.000, OR = 3.696, and 95% C.I = 1.936 lower and upper 7.055).
Religion was associated with FP use (p=.002, OR =2.802, 95% C.I = 1.476 lower and
5.321 upper), communication and FP use were significantly associated, (p=.000, OR
= 0.323 and 95% C.I = 0.215) lower and upper = 0.483), social network and FP use 
(p=.000, OR = 2.162 and 95% C.I = 1.495 lower and upper =3.125) and knowledge and
FP use(p=.000, OR = 2.224 and 95% C.I = 1.509 lower and upper =3.278). Wealth
showed a significant association with FP use (p=.001, OR = 1.897, 95% C.I = 0.817
lower and 4.404).Urban area was positively associated with FP use (p= .000, OR = 
0.008 and 95% C.I = 0.001 lower and upper =0.09), semi urban was significant at
(p= .004, OR = 3.733 and C.I = 1.513 lower and upper =9.211). Information,
education and communication materials and to promote family planning in Tanzania 
should designed and promoted.

Gastric outlet obstruction at Bugando Medical Centre in Northwestern Tanzania: a 
prospective review of 184 cases.

Jaka H, McHembe MD, Rambau PF, Chalya PL.

BACKGROUND: Gastric outlet obstruction poses diagnostic and therapeutic
challenges to general surgeons practicing in resource-limited countries. There is
a paucity of published data on this subject in our setting. This study was
undertaken to highlight the etiological spectrum and treatment outcome of gastric
outlet obstruction in our setting and to identify prognostic factors for
morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: This was a descriptive prospective study which was conducted at Bugando 
Medical Centre between March 2009 and February 2013. All patients with a clinical
diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction were, after informed consent for the
study, consecutively enrolled into the study. Statistical data analysis was done 
using SPSS computer software version 17.0.
RESULTS: A total of 184 patients were studied. More than two-third of patients
were males. Patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction were older than
those of benign type. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). 
Gastric cancer was the commonest malignant cause of gastric outlet obstruction
where as peptic ulcer disease was the commonest benign cause. In children, the
commonest cause of gastric outlet obstruction was congenital pyloric stenosis
(13.0%). Non-bilious vomiting (100%) and weight loss (93.5%) were the most
frequent symptoms. Eighteen (9.8%) patients were HIV positive with the median CD 
4+ count of 282 cells/mul. A total of 168 (91.3%) patients underwent surgery. Of 
these, gastro-jejunostomy (61.9%) was the most common surgical procedure
performed. The complication rate was 32.1 % mainly surgical site infections
(38.2%). The median hospital stay and mortality rate were 14 days and 18.5%
respectively. The presence of postoperative complication was the main predictor
of hospital stay (p = 0.002), whereas the age > 60 years, co-existing medical
illness, malignant cause, HIV positivity, low CD 4 count (<200 cells/mul), high
ASA class and presence of surgical site infection significantly predicted
mortality ( p< 0.001). The follow up of patients was generally poor as more than 
60% of patients were lost to follow up.
CONCLUSION: Gastric outlet obstruction in our setting is more prevalent in males 
and the cause is mostly malignant. The majority of patients present late with
poor general condition. Early recognition of the diagnosis, aggressive
resuscitation and early institution of surgical management is of paramount
importance if morbidity and mortality associated with gastric outlet obstruction 
are to be avoided.

The Trade-Off between Accuracy and Accessibility of Syphilis Screening Assays.

Smit PW, Mabey D, Changalucha J, Mngara J, Clark B, Andreasen A, Todd J, Urassa
M, Zaba B, Peeling RW.

Department of Infectious & Tropical diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical
Medicine, London, United Kingdom.

The availability of rapid and sensitive methods to diagnose syphilis facilitates 
screening of pregnant women, which is one of the most cost-effective health
interventions available. We have evaluated two screening methods in Tanzania: an 
enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and a point-of-care test (POCT). We evaluated the
performance of each test against the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination
assay (TPPA) as the reference method, and the accessibility of testing in a rural
district of Tanzania. The POCT was performed in the clinic on whole blood, while 
the other assays were performed on plasma in the laboratory. Samples were also
tested by the rapid plasma Reagin (RPR) test. With TPPA as reference assay, the
sensitivity and specificity of EIA were 95.3% and 97.8%, and of the POCT were
59.6% and 99.4% respectively. The sensitivity of the POCT and EIA for active
syphilis cases (TPPA positive and RPR titer â‰¥1/8) were 82% and 100% respectively.
Only 15% of antenatal clinic attenders in this district visited a health facility
with a laboratory capable of performing the EIA. Although it is less sensitive
than EIA, its greater accessibility, and the fact that treatment can be given on 
the same day, means that the use of POCT would result in a higher proportion of
women with syphilis receiving treatment than with the EIA in this district of
Tanzania.

Plasma Concentrations of Efavirenz and Nevirapine among HIV-Infected Patients
with Immunological Failure Attending a Tertiary Hospital in North-Western
Tanzania.

Kongola GW, Klinker H.

Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Catholic University of
Health and Allied Sciences, Mwanza, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Sub-therapeutic and supra-therapeutic plasma concentrations of
antriretrovirals are the significant causes of treatment failure and toxicity
respectively among HIV-infected patients. We conducted this study to determine
the pattern of efavirenz and nevirapine plasma drug concentrations among adult
HIV-infected patients with immunological failure attending at a tertiary hospital
in North-western Tanzania.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult
HIV-infected patients with immunological failure who have been on either
efavirenz or nevirapine based antiretroviral regimen for more than 6 months.
Patients were serially enrolled through routine Care and Treatment Clinic (CTC)
activities. Plasma drug concentrations for efavirenz and nevirapine were
determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Gas
Chromatography (GC) respectively. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data such 
as viral load and CD4 counts were collected. Data analysis was done using STATA
12.
RESULTS: Of the 152 patients with immunological failure enrolled, the
sub-therapeutic, therapeutic and supra-therapeutic plasma antiretroviral drug
concentrations were found in 43/152 (28.3%), 76/152 (50.0%) and 33/152 (21.7%)
respectively. Half of the patients were outside therapeutic window with either
sub-therapeutic or supra-therapeutic plasma ARV drug concentrations. There was a 
significant difference in distribution of ARV adherence (p-value<0.001), NRTI
backbone (p-valueâ€Š=â€Š0.039), HIV stage (p-valueâ€Š=â€Š0.026) and viral load
(p-valueâ€Š=â€Š0.007) within sub-therapeutic, therapeutic and supra-therapeutic ARV
plasma drug concentrations.
CONCLUSION: There is a wide inter-individual variability of plasma ARV
concentrations among HIV patients with immunological failure, with a large
proportion of patients being outside therapeutic window. This variability is
significant based on ARV adherence, NRTI backbone, viral load and HIV stage.
Routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) could assist identifying these patients
early and making timely correction to avoid virological failure, poor
immunological outcome and prevent associated drug toxicities. Nonetheless, ARV
adherence should be strictly emphasized on HIV patients with immunological
failure.

The trophy hunting of african lions: scale, current management practices and
factors undermining sustainability.

Lindsey PA, Balme GA, Funston P, Henschel P, Hunter L, Madzikanda H, Midlane N,
Nyirenda V.

Lion Program, Panthera, New York, United States of America ; Mammal Research
Institute, Department of Zoology and Entomology, University of Pretoria,
Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa.

The trophy hunting of lions Panthera leo is contentious due to uncertainty
concerning conservation impacts and because of highly polarised opinions about
the practice. African lions are hunted across at least âˆ¼558,000 km(2), which
comprises 27-32% of the lion range in countries where trophy hunting of the
species is permitted. Consequently, trophy hunting has potential to impart
significant positive or negative impacts on lions. Several studies have
demonstrated that excessive trophy harvests have driven lion population declines.
There have been several attempts by protectionist non-governmental organisations 
to reduce or preclude trophy hunting via restrictions on the import and export of
lion trophies. We document the management of lion hunting in Africa and highlight
challenges which need addressing to achieve sustainability. Problems include:
unscientific bases for quota setting; excessive quotas and off-takes in some
countries; fixed quotas which encourage over-harvest; and lack of restrictions on
the age of lions that can be hunted. Key interventions needed to make lion
hunting more sustainable, include implementation of: enforced age restrictions;
improved trophy monitoring; adaptive management of quotas and a minimum length of
lion hunts of at least 21 days. Some range states have made important steps
towards implementing such improved management and off-takes have fallen steeply
in recent years. For example age restrictions have been introduced in Tanzania
and in Niassa in Mozambique, and are being considered for Benin and Zimbabwe,
several states have reduced quotas, and Zimbabwe is implementing trophy
monitoring. However, further reforms are needed to ensure sustainability and
reduce conservation problems associated with the practice while allowing
retention of associated financial incentives for conservation.

Health worker factors associated with prescribing of artemisinin combination
therapy for uncomplicated malaria in rural Tanzania.

Selemani M, Masanja IM, Kajungu D, Amuri M, Njozi M, Khatib RA, Abdulla S, de
Savigny D.

BACKGROUND: Improving malaria case management is partially dependent on health
worker compliance with clinical guidelines. This study assessed health worker
factors associated with correct anti-malarial prescribing practices at two sites 
in rural Tanzania.
METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional health facility surveys were conducted during
high and low malaria transmission seasons in 2010 and collected information on
patient consultations and health worker characteristics. Using logistic
regression, the study assessed health worker factors associated with correct
prescription for uncomplicated malaria defined as prescription of
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for patients with fever and
Plasmodium falciparum asexual infection based on blood slide or malaria rapid
diagnostic test (RDT) according to national treatment guidelines.
RESULTS: The analysis included 685 patients with uncomplicated malaria who were
seen in a health facility with ACT in stock, and 71 health workers practicing in 
30 health facilities. Overall, 58% of malaria patients were correctly treated
with ACT. Health workers with three or more years' work experience were
significantly more likely than others to prescribe correctly (adjusted odds ratio
(aOR) 2.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-7.1; p = 0.019). Clinical officers
(aOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.5; p = 0.037), and nurse aide or lower cadre (aOR 3.1; 95%
CI 1.3-7.1; p = 0.009) were more likely to correctly prescribe ACT than medical
officers. Training on ACT use, supervision visits, and availability of job aids
were not significantly associated with correct prescription.
CONCLUSIONS: Years of working experience and health worker cadre were associated 
with correct ACT prescription for uncomplicated malaria. Targeted interventions
to improve health worker performance are needed to improve overall malaria case
management.

HIV-1 drug resistance in recently HIV-infected pregnant mother's naive to
antiretroviral therapy in Dodoma urban, Tanzania.

Vairo F, Nicastri E, Liuzzi G, Chaula Z, Nguhuni B, Bevilacqua N, Forbici F,
Amendola A, Fabeni L, De Nardo P, Perno CF, Cannas A, Sakhoo C, Capobianchi MR,
Ippolito G.

BACKGROUND: HIV resistance affects virological response to therapy and efficacy
of prophylaxis in mother-to-child-transmission. The study aims to assess the
prevalence of HIV primary resistance in pregnant women naive to antiretrovirals.
METHODS: Cross sectional baseline analysis of a cohort of HIV + pregnant women
(HPW) enrolled in the study entitled Antiretroviral Management of Antenatal and
Natal HIV Infection (AMANI, peace in Kiswahili language). The AMANI study began
in May 2010 in Dodoma, Tanzania. In this observational cohort, antiretroviral
treatment was provided to all women from the 28th week of gestation until the end
of the breastfeeding period. Baseline CD4 cell count, viral load and HIV
drug-resistance genotype were collected.
RESULTS: Drug-resistance analysis was performed on 97 naive infected-mothers. The
prevalence of all primary drug resistance and primary non-nucleoside
reverse-transcriptase inhibitors resistance was 11.9% and 7.5%, respectively.
K103S was found in two women with no M184V detection. HIV-1 subtype A was the
most commonly identified, with a high prevalence of subtype A1, followed by C, D,
C/D recombinant, A/C recombinant and A/D recombinant. HIV drug- resistance
mutations were detected in A1 and C subtypes.
CONCLUSION: Our study reports an 11.9% prevalence rate of primary drug resistance
in naive HIV-infected pregnant women from a remote area of Tanzania. Considering 
that the non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors are part of the
first-line antiretroviral regimen in Tanzania and all of Africa, resistance
surveys should be prioritized in settings where antiretroviral therapy programs
are scaled up.

Condom use and sexuality communication with adults: a study among high school
students in South Africa and Tanzania.

Namisi FS, Aarø LE, Kaaya S, Onya HE, Wubs A, Mathews C.

BACKGROUND: Fostering adolescents' communication on sexuality issues with their
parents and other significant adults is often assumed to be an important
component of intervention programmes aimed at promoting healthy adolescent sexual
practices. However, there are few studies describing the relationship between
such communication and sexual practices, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This
study examined the relationships between adolescents' communication with
significant adults and their condom use in three sites in this region.
METHODS: Data stem from a multi-site randomized controlled trial of a
school-based HIV prevention intervention implemented in Cape Town and Mankweng,
South Africa and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Only data from comparison schools were 
used. The design is therefore a prospective panel study with three waves of data 
collections. Data were collected in 2004 from 6,251 participants in 40 schools.
Associations between adolescents' communication with adults about sexuality
issues and their use of condoms were analysed cross-sectionally using analysis of
variance, as well as prospectively using multiple ordinal logistic regression
analysis.
RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses showed that consistent condom users had
significantly higher mean scores on communication (across topics and
communication partners) than both occasional users and never-users, who had the
lowest scores. After controlling for condom use at the first data collection
occasion in each model as well as for possible confounders, communication scores 
significantly predicted consistent condom use prospectively in all three ordinal 
logistic regression models (Model R2 = .23 to .31).
CONCLUSION: The findings are consistent with the assertion that communication on 
sexuality issues between adolescents and significant adults results in safer
sexual practices, as reflected by condom use, among in-school adolescents. The
associations between communication variables and condom use might have been
stronger if we had measured additional aspects of communication such as whether
or not it was initiated by the adolescents themselves, the quality of advice
provided by adults, and if it took place in a context of positive
adult-adolescent interaction. Studies with experimental designs are needed in
order to provide stronger evidence of causality.

Declining burden of malaria over two decades in a rural community of Muheza
district, north-eastern Tanzania.

Ishengoma DS, Mmbando BP, Segeja MD, Alifrangis M, Lemnge MM, Bygbjerg IC.

BACKGROUND: The recently reported declining burden of malaria in some African
countries has been attributed to scaling-up of different interventions although
in some areas, these changes started before implementation of major
interventions. This study assessed the long-term trends of malaria burden for 20 
years (1992--2012) in Magoda and for 15 years in Mpapayu village of Muheza
district, north-eastern Tanzania, in relation to different interventions as well 
as changing national malaria control policies.
METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional surveys recruited individuals aged 0 -- 19
years from the two villages whereby blood smears were collected for detection of 
malaria parasites by microscopy. Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infections
and other indices of malaria burden (prevalence of anaemia, splenomegaly and
gametocytes) were compared across the years and between the study villages. Major
interventions deployed including mobile clinic, bed nets and other research
activities, and changes in national malaria control policies were also marked.
RESULTS: In Magoda, the prevalence of P. falciparum infections initially
decreased between 1992 and 1996 (from 83.5 to 62.0%), stabilized between 1996 and
1997, and further declined to 34.4% in 2004. A temporary increase between 2004
and 2008 was followed by a progressive decline to 7.2% in 2012, which is more
than 10-fold decrease since 1992. In Mpapayu (from 1998), the highest prevalence 
was 81.5% in 1999 and it decreased to 25% in 2004. After a slight increase in
2008, a steady decline followed, reaching <5% from 2011 onwards. Bed net usage
was high in both villages from 1999 to 2004 (>=88%) but it decreased between 2008
and 2012 (range, 28% - 68%). After adjusting for the effects of bed nets, age,
fever and year of study, the risk of P. falciparum infections decreased
significantly by >=97% in both villages between 1999 and 2012 (p < 0.001). The
prevalence of splenomegaly (>40% to <1%) and gametocytes (23% to <1%) also
decreased in both villages.Discussion and conclusionsA remarkable decline in the 
burden of malaria occurred between 1992 and 2012 and the initial decline (1992 --
2004) was most likely due to deployment of interventions, such as bed nets, and
better services through research activities. Apart from changes of drug policies,
the steady decline observed from 2008 occurred when bed net coverage was low
suggesting that other factors contributed to the most recent pattern. These
results suggest that continued monitoring is required to determine causes of the 
changing malaria epidemiology and also to monitor the progress towards
maintaining low malaria transmission and reaching related millennium development 
goals.

Comparing sociocultural features of cholera in three endemic African settings.

Schaetti C, Sundaram N, Merten S, Ali SM, Nyambedha EO, Lapika B, Chaignat CL,
Hutubessy R, Weiss MG.

BACKGROUND: Cholera mainly affects developing countries where safe water supply
and sanitation infrastructure are often rudimentary. Sub-Saharan Africa is a
cholera hotspot. Effective cholera control requires not only a professional
assessment, but also consideration of community-based priorities. The present
work compares local sociocultural features of endemic cholera in urban and rural 
sites from three field studies in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo
(SE-DRC), western Kenya and Zanzibar.
METHODS: A vignette-based semistructured interview was used in 2008 in Zanzibar
to study sociocultural features of cholera-related illness among 356 men and
women from urban and rural communities. Similar cross-sectional surveys were
performed in western Kenya (n = 379) and in SE-DRC (n = 360) in 2010. Systematic 
comparison across all settings considered the following domains: illness
identification; perceived seriousness, potential fatality and past household
episodes; illness-related experience; meaning; knowledge of prevention;
help-seeking behavior; and perceived vulnerability.
RESULTS: Cholera is well known in all three settings and is understood to have a 
significant impact on people's lives. Its social impact was mainly characterized 
by financial concerns. Problems with unsafe water, sanitation and dirty
environments were the most common perceived causes across settings; nonetheless, 
non-biomedical explanations were widespread in rural areas of SE-DRC and
Zanzibar. Safe food and water and vaccines were prioritized for prevention in
SE-DRC. Safe water was prioritized in western Kenya along with sanitation and
health education. The latter two were also prioritized in Zanzibar. Use of oral
rehydration solutions and rehydration was a top priority everywhere; healthcare
facilities were universally reported as a primary source of help. Respondents in 
SE-DRC and Zanzibar reported cholera as affecting almost everybody without
differentiating much for gender, age and class. In contrast, in western Kenya,
gender differentiation was pronounced, and children and the poor were regarded as
most vulnerable to cholera.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive review identified common and distinctive features
of local understandings of cholera. Classical treatment (that is, rehydration)
was highlighted as a priority for control in the three African study settings and
is likely to be identified in the region beyond. Findings indicate the value of
insight from community studies to guide local program planning for cholera
control and elimination.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) in another big cat: should CDV be renamed carnivore 
distemper virus?

Terio KA, Craft ME.

Zoological Pathology Program University of Illinois, Maywood, Illinois, USA.
kterio@illinois.edu

One of the greatest threats to the conservation of wild cat populations may be
dogs or, at least, one of their viruses. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a
single-stranded RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family and genus Morbillivirus, 
infects and causes disease in a variety of species, not just canids. An outbreak 
of CDV in wild lions in the Serengeti, Tanzania, in 1994 was a wake-up call for
conservationists, as it demonstrated that an infectious disease could swiftly
impact a previously healthy felid population. To understand how this virus causes
disease in noncanid hosts, researchers have focused on specific mutations in the 
binding site of the CDV hemagglutinin gene. Now, Seimon et al. provide
information on CDV in its latest feline victim, the endangered wild Amur tiger
(Panthera tigris altaica) [T. A. Seimon et al., mBio 4(4):e00410-13, 2013,
doi:10.1128/mBio.00410-13]. Their findings of CDV strains infecting tigers, in
combination with recent information from other felids, paints a different
picture, one in which CDV strains from a variety of geographic lineages and with 
a variety of amino acid residues in the hemagglutinin gene binding site can
infect cats and cause disease. Although CDV has been known as a multihost disease
since its discovery in domestic dogs in 1905, perhaps it is time to reconsider
whether these noncanid species are not just incidental or "spillover" hosts but, 
rather, a normal part of the complex ecology of this infectious disease.

Warm ocean processes and carbon cycling in the Eocene.

John EH, Pearson PN, Coxall HK, Birch H, Wade BS, Foster GL.

School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, Cardiff University, , Park Place, Cardiff
CF10Â 3AT, UK.

Sea surface and subsurface temperatures over large parts of the ocean during the 
Eocene epoch (55.5-33.7â€‰Ma) exceeded modern values by several degrees, which must
have affected a number of oceanic processes. Here, we focus on the effect of
elevated water column temperatures on the efficiency of the biological pump,
particularly in relation to carbon and nutrient cycling. We use stable isotope
values from exceptionally well-preserved planktonic foraminiferal calcite from
Tanzania and Mexico to reconstruct vertical carbon isotope gradients in the upper
water column, exploiting the fact that individual species lived and calcified at 
different depths. The oxygen isotope ratios of different species' tests are used 
to estimate the temperature of calcification, which we converted to absolute
depths using Eocene temperature profiles generated by general circulation models.
This approach, along with potential pitfalls, is illustrated using data from
modern core-top assemblages from the same area. Our results indicate that, during
the Early and Middle Eocene, carbon isotope gradients were steeper (and larger)
through the upper thermocline than in the modern ocean. This is consistent with a
shallower average depth of organic matter remineralization and supports
previously proposed hypotheses that invoke high metabolic rates in a warm Eocene 
ocean, leading to more efficient recycling of organic matter and reduced burial
rates of organic carbon.

Hookworm infection and environmental factors in mbeya region, Tanzania: a
cross-sectional, population-based study.

University of Munich, Munich, Germany ; Institute for Medical Bioinformatics,
Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Hookworm disease is one of the most common infections and cause of a 
high disease burden in the tropics and subtropics. Remotely sensed ecological
data and model-based geostatistics have been used recently to identify areas in
need for hookworm control.
METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional interview data and stool samples from 6,375
participants from nine different sites in Mbeya region, south-western Tanzania,
were collected as part of a cohort study. Hookworm infection was assessed by
microscopy of duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears from one stool sample from each
participant. A geographic information system was used to obtain remotely sensed
environmental data such as land surface temperature (LST), vegetation cover,
rainfall, and elevation, and combine them with hookworm infection data and with
socio-demographic and behavioral data. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression
was performed on sites separately and on the pooled dataset.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Univariable analyses yielded significant associations for all
ecological variables. Five ecological variables stayed significant in the final
multivariable model: population density (odds ratio (OR)â€Š=â€Š0.68; 95% confidence
interval (CI)â€Š=â€Š0.63-0.73), mean annual vegetation density (ORâ€Š=â€Š0.11; 95%
CIâ€Š=â€Š0.06-0.18), mean annual LST during the day (ORâ€Š=â€Š0.81; 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š0.75-0.88), 
mean annual LST during the night (ORâ€Š=â€Š1.54; 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.44-1.64), and latrine
coverage in household surroundings (ORâ€Š=â€Š1.02; 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.01-1.04). Interaction
terms revealed substantial differences in associations of hookworm infection with
population density, mean annual enhanced vegetation index, and latrine coverage
between the two sites with the highest prevalence of infection.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports previous findings that remotely
sensed data such as vegetation indices, LST, and elevation are strongly
associated with hookworm prevalence. However, the results indicate that the
influence of environmental conditions can differ substantially within a
relatively small geographic area. The use of large-scale associations as a
predictive tool on smaller scales is therefore problematic and should be handled 
with care.

Lost in Translation: Assessing Effectiveness of Focus Group Questioning
Techniques to Develop Improved Translation of Terminology Used in HIV Prevention 
Clinical Trials.

Mack N, Ramirez CB, Friedland B, Nnko S.

Social and Behavioral Health Sciences, FHI 360, Durham, North Carolina, United
States of America.

INTRODUCTION: Achieving participant comprehension has proven to be one of the
most difficult, practical, and ethical challenges of HIV prevention clinical
trials. It becomes even more challenging when local languages do not have
equivalent scientific and technical vocabularies, rendering communication of
scientific concepts in translated documents extremely difficult. Even when
bilingual lexicons are developed, there is no guarantee that participants
understand the terminology as translated.
METHODS: WE CONDUCTED TWELVE FOCUS GROUPS WITH WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE IN
MWANZA, TANZANIA TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOUR QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES FOR:
(1) assessing participants' familiarity with existing technical terms and
concepts, (2) generating a list of acceptable technical and non-technical terms, 
(3) testing our definitions of technical terms, and (4) verifying participants'
preferences for terms. Focus groups were transcribed, translated, and
qualitatively analyzed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A translation process that uses all four questioning
techniques in a step-wise approach is an effective way to establish a baseline
understanding of participants' familiarity with research terms, to develop and
test translatable definitions, and to identify participants' preferred
terminology for international HIV clinical research. This may help to ensure that
important concepts are not "lost in translation." The results emphasize the
importance of using a variety of techniques depending on the level of participant
familiarity with research concepts, the existence of colloquial or technical
terms in the target language, and the inherent complexity of the terms.

New lucinid bivalves from shallow and deeper water of the Indian and West Pacific
Oceans (Mollusca, Bivalvia, Lucinidae).

Taylor JD, Glover EA.

Department of Life Sciences, The Natural History Museum, London SW7 5BD, UK.

Four new species and a new genus of lucinid bivalves are described from shallow
and deeper waters in the Indian and West Pacific Oceans. The new genus
Scabrilucina (subfamily Lucininae) includes the little-known Scabrilucina
victorialis (Melvill, 1899) from the Arabian Sea and Scabrilucina vitrea
(Deshayes, 1844) from the Andaman Sea as well as a new species Scabrilucina
melvilli from the Torres Strait off northeastern Australia. Ferrocina brunei new 
species (Lucininae) was recovered from 60 m near oil drilling activities off
Borneo; its anatomy confirmed the presence of symbiotic bacteria. Two unusual
deeper water species of Leucosphaerinae are described, both species included in
on-going molecular analyses; Gonimyrtea ferruginea from 400-650 m in the
southwest Pacific and Myrtina reflexa from 200-825 m off Zanzibar and Madagascar.

Knowledge among drug dispensers and antimalarial drug prescribing practices in
public health facilities in Dar es Salaam.

Kamuhabwa AA, Silumbe R.

Unit of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, School of Pharmacy, Muhimbili University
of Health and Allied Sciences.

BACKGROUND: Irrational prescribing and dispensing of antimalarials has been
identified as a contributing factor in the emergence of malaria parasites
resistant to existing antimalarial drugs. Factors that contribute to such
irrational prescribing and dispensing should therefore be identified to address
this problem. The aim of this study was to assess irrational antimalarial drug
dispensing and prescribing practices in public health facilities.
METHODS: A descriptive-retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between 
January and June 2011 in order to assess prescribing and dispensing practices for
antimalarial drugs in three public hospitals and nine health centers in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. Thirty-two drug dispensers were interviewed using a structured 
questionnaire. A total of 4,320 prescriptions for the period January to December 
2010 were collected and assessed for antimalarial drug prescribing patterns.
RESULTS: The majority (84.6%) of drug dispensers had poor knowledge regarding the
basic information required from patients before dispensing
artemether-lumefantrine. Seventeen of 32 drug dispensers did not know the basic
information that should be given to patients in order to increase absorption of
artemether-lumefantrine after oral intake. Most drug dispensers also showed
limited knowledge about the dosage and contraindications for
artemether-lumefantrine. Eighty-seven percent of all prescriptions contained
artemether-lumefantrine as the only antimalarial drug, 77.1% contained at least
one analgesic, and 26.9% contained at least one antibiotic, indicating
unnecessary use of analgesics and antibiotics with antimalarial drugs. A
substantial number of prescriptions contained antimalarial drugs that have
already been declared ineffective for the treatment of malaria in Tanzania,
providing additional evidence of inadequate knowledge among health care workers
concerning treatment policy.
CONCLUSION: Despite the government's efforts to increase public awareness
regarding use of artemether-lumefantrine as first-line treatment for
uncomplicated malaria, there is still irrational prescribing, dispensing, and use
of this combination. Based on the results of this study, it is proposed that
regular on-the-job training and continuing education be provided to drug
dispensers and prescribers in public health facilities.

Current treatment and outcome for childhood acute leukemia in Tanzania.

Kersten E, Scanlan P, Dubois SG, Matthay KK.

Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco School of
Medicine and UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California.

BACKGROUND: In order to understand the disparity in childhood leukemia survival
in low-income countries (LICs) compared to high-income countries (HICs), we
evaluated the resources available at Tanzania's national pediatric oncology ward,
and clinical characteristics, disease course and outcomes of children diagnosed
with acute leukemia from 2008 through 2010.
PROCEDURES: A chart review and assessment of services was performed to assess
childhood leukemia diagnoses, treatment, and outcomes in Tanzania at the Ocean
Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. Results
were compared to those from a 2005 evaluation that showed only one of 20 children
with leukemia surviving at 1 year.
RESULTS: During the study period, 106 patients presented with leukemia, including
81 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 25 with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). Forty-nine of 58 (84%) patients with ALL, and six of 17 (35%)
with AML who received therapy and had complete data, achieved complete remission.
Estimated 2-year event-free survival for all patients with ALL was 33%; for AML
it was 0%. Ten patients died prior to initiation of therapy, 19 died of toxicity,
and eight abandoned therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Though leukemia survival in Tanzania remains far below that in HICs,
survival rates for ALL have significantly improved in recent years due to
standardization of treatment regimens and better staff, though AML outcome
remains dismal. Ongoing improvements in pediatric leukemia outcomes will require 
strategies to improve awareness and early access to treatment coupled with
improvements in diagnostic capabilities, supportive care, and training. Pediatr

Innovative accountability of tracking test kit as locked resources: a lesson in a
restricted resource setting.

Makuwani AM, Msuya S, Haule D, Mogella D, Nkya E.

Former NBTS, Operations Officer, Ministry of Health and Social Welfare-RCHS,
Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: To implement quality screening in a blood service requires the
presence of screening strategy with a clear algorithm and supporting standard
operating procedures (SOPs), skilled and motivated human resource to perform
testing, infrastructure, regular available test kits, and other supplies. In
developing countries, smooth supply chain management of critical transfusion
transmissible infections (TTIs) screening reagents is a challenge. Therefore,
managing the little available kits by knowing the rate of consumption, good
forecasting, and monitoring expiry date may be a key in ensuring regular supply.
METHOD: Test kit monitoring tool (TKMT) for Vironostika HIV Uni-Form kit/192 1&2 
Ag/Ab, Genedia kits for HBsAg and HCV, and RPR for syphilis was developed to
track these reagents. This excel tool was developed to assess received reagents, 
quantity used, quantity remaining, and date of expiration. The tool was evaluated
by assessing rerun for each test kits, match tests conducted with blood units
tested, adherence to the principle of first in-first out (FIFO), and quantity
remaining in the center against the need.
RESULTS: The mean rerun for HIV ELISA Vironistika uniform II Ag/Ab observed over 
expected was 6.9% (n = 3.8) than 2.4% (n = 1.3), HBsAg was 9.9% (n = 5.7) than
6.7% (3.5) (expected), Genedia for HCV was 1.3% (n = 0.7) than 0.5% (n = 0.3),
and RPR test for syphilis 3.3% (n = 1.5) than 0.5%. During implementation, TKMT
managed to detect expiring kits in the zonal blood transfusion centers.
CONCLUSION: A tool-like TKMT may capture other supplies within blood when
expanded. Monitoring of supplies may enable blood service actual accounting and
in forecasting supplies and reagents.

The importance of health policy and systems research and analysis (HPSR+A) is
widely recognized. Universities are central to strengthening and sustaining the
HPSR+A capacity as they teach the next generation of decision-makers and health
professionals. However, little is known about the capacity of universities,
specifically, to develop the field. In this article, we report results of
capacity self- assessments by seven universities within five African countries,
conducted through the Consortium for Health Policy and Systems Analysis in Africa
(CHEPSAA). The capacity assessments focused on both capacity 'assets' and
'needs', and covered the wider context, as well as organizational and individual 
capacity levels. Six thematic areas of capacity were examined: leadership and
governance, organizations' resources, scope of HPSR+A teaching and research,
communication, networking and getting research into policy and practice (GRIPP), 
demand for HPRS+A and resource environment. The self-assessments by each
university used combinations of document reviews, semi-structured interviews and 
staff surveys, followed by comparative analysis. A framework approach, guided by 
the six thematic areas, was used to analyse data. We found that HPSR+A is an
international priority, and an existing activity in Africa, though still
neglected field with challenges including its reliance on unpredictable
international funding. All universities have capacity assets, such as ongoing
HPSR+A teaching and research. There are, however, varying levels of assets (such 
as differences in staff numbers, group sizes and amount of HPSR+A teaching and
research), which, combined with different capacity needs at all three levels
(such as individual training, improvement in systems for quality assurance and
fostering demand for HPSR+A work), can shape a future agenda for HPSR+A capacity 
strengthening. Capacity assets and needs at different levels appear related.
Possible integrated strategies for strengthening universities' capacity include: 
refining HPSR+A vision, mainstreaming the subject into under- and post-graduate
teaching, developing emerging leaders and aligning HPSR+A capacity strengthening 
within the wider organizational development.

SIV-induced instability of the chimpanzee gut microbiome.

Simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzees (SIVcpz) is the ancestor of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the etiologic agent of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. Like HIV-1-infected humans,
SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees can develop AIDS-like symptoms. Because SIVcpz/HIV-1 
may disrupt regulation of the gut microbiome and because it has not been possible
to sample individual humans pre- and postinfection, we investigated the influence
of infection on gut communities through long-term monitoring of chimpanzees from 
Gombe National Park, Tanzania. SIVcpz infection accelerated the rate of change in
gut microbiota composition within individuals for periods of years after the
initial infection and led to gut communities marked by high frequencies of
pathogen-containing bacterial genera absent from SIVcpz-negative individuals. Our
results indicate that immune function maintains temporally stable gut communities
that are lost when individuals become infected with SIVcpz.

Application of quantitative second-line drug susceptibility testing at a
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis hospital in Tanzania.

Mpagama SG, Houpt ER, Stroup S, Kumburu H, Gratz J, Kibiki GS, Heysell SK.

BACKGROUND: Lack of rapid and reliable susceptibility testing for second-line
drugs used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) may
limit treatment success.
METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients referred to Kibong'oto
National TB Hospital in Tanzania for second-line TB treatment underwent
confirmatory speciation and susceptibility testing. Minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) testing on MYCOTB Sensititre plates was performed for all
drugs available in the second-line formulary. We chose to categorize isolates as 
borderline susceptible if the MIC was at or one dilution lower than the
resistance breakpoint. M. tuberculosis DNA was sequenced for resistance mutations
in rpoB (rifampin), inhA (isoniazid, ethionamide), katG (isoniazid), embB
(ethambutol), gyrA (fluoroquinolones), rrs (amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin),
eis (kanamycin) and pncA (pyrazinamide).
RESULTS: Of 22 isolates from patients referred for second-line TB treatment, 13
(59%) were MDR-TB and the remainder had other resistance patterns. MIC testing
identified 3 (14%) isolates resistant to ethionamide and another 8 (36%) with
borderline susceptibility. No isolate had ofloxacin resistance, but 10 (45%) were
borderline susceptible. Amikacin was fully susceptible in 15 (68%) compared to
only 11 (50%) for kanamycin. Resistance mutations were absent in gyrA, rrs or eis
for all 13 isolates available for sequencing, but pncA mutation resultant in
amino acid change or stop codon was present in 6 (46%). Ten (77%) of MDR-TB
patients had at least one medication that could have logically been modified
based on these results (median 2; maximum 4). The most common modifications were 
a change from ethioniamide to para-aminosalicylic acid, and the use of higher
dose levofloxacin.
CONCLUSIONS: In Tanzania, quantitative second-line susceptibility testing could
inform and alter MDR-TB management independent of drug-resistance mutations.
Further operational studies are warranted.

Allied Sciences (MUHAS) , Dar es Salaam, Tanzania .

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage, risk factors of colonization and
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of S. aureus strains. The study was
conducted at the Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Nasal
swabs were obtained from children and S. aureus was isolated and identified using
conventional culture methods. MRSA was screened and confirmed using the cefoxitin
disk and multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Antibiotic 
susceptibility was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. MRSA
isolates were further characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
profiling. Of 285 children included in the study, S. aureus was detected in 114
(40%). Of the 114 isolates, 12 (10.5%) were MRSA. PFGE results showed that these 
MRSA isolates are epidemiologically unrelated. Resistance of all S. aureus to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin was
65.8%, 23.7%, 27.2%, and 4.4%, respectively. No resistance to vancomycin was
found. The prevalence of inducible clindamycin resistance, constitutive
clindamycin resistance, MS phenotype (resistance to erythromycin alone), and
multidrug resistance was 16.7%, 1.8%, 14.0%, and 16.8%, respectively. None of the
risk factors examined was found to be significant. This is the first report of S.
aureus and nasal carriage of MRSA and a high rate of S. aureus carriage was found
in Tanzanian under-5 children. The study findings support the need for proper
health education and effective infection control measures for healthcare workers.

Timeliness and completeness of vaccination and risk factors for low and late
vaccine uptake in young children living in rural southern Tanzania.

Le Polain de Waroux O, Schellenberg JR, Manzi F, Mrisho M, Shirima K, Mshinda H, 
Alonso P, Tanner M, Schellenberg DM.

Department of Infectious and Tropical Disease, London School of Hygiene &
Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street,Â LondonÂ WC1E 7HT,Â UK.

BACKGROUND: We studied coverage and timeliness of vaccination and risk factors
for low and delayed vaccine uptake in children aged <2 years in rural Tanzania.
METHODS: We used data from a cluster survey conducted in 2004, which included
1403 children. Risk factors were analysed by log-binomial regression adjusted for
the clustering. The analysis was restricted to BCG, first and third dose of
Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccines (DTP-1 and DTP-3) and first dose of
measles-containing vaccine (MCV-1).
RESULTS: Coverage for BCG, DTP-1, DTP-3 and MCV-1 was 94%, 96%, 90% and 86%,
respectively. Delayed vaccination (>1 month after the recommended age) occurred
in 398/1205 (33%) children for BCG, 404/1189 (34%) for DTP-1, 683/990 (69%) for
DTP-3 and 296/643 (46%) for MCV-1. Coverage was lower for all vaccines except
DTP-1 in children living â‰¥5 km from a healthcare facility. Delayed uptake was
associated with poverty. Low and delayed MCV-1 vaccination was associated with
low maternal education. Delayed BCG vaccination was associated with ethnicity and
rainy season.
CONCLUSION: Despite reasonably high vaccination coverage, we observed substantial
vaccination delays, particularly for DTP-3 and MCV-1. We found specific factors
associated with low and/or delayed vaccine uptake. These findings can help to
improve strategies to reach children who remain inadequately protected.

Systemic constraints continue to limit coverage of intermittent preventive
treatment for malaria in pregnancy in southeast Tanzania.

Graham KJ, Ba-Break MM.

Ifakara Health Institute, Rufiji Health Demographic Surveillance System, Folk
Development College, Ikwiriri, PO Box 40, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Factors limiting coverage of intermittent preventive treatment for
malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) in Tanzania were explored from the perspective of
health workers, in order to make recommendations to improve service delivery.
Recent data estimates coverage of the recommended two doses of IPTp at 26.3%, far
short of the national target of 80%.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 health workers and 2
health managers during June 2011 in Ikwiriri, southeast Tanzania.
RESULTS: Delivery of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was severely constrained by
drug shortages and widespread stock-outs, indicative of ongoing difficulties in
the wider health system. While SP was well known and attitudes towards IPTp were 
positive, health workers were often not informed of up-to-date dosing schedules, 
limiting coverage. Recent literature suggests this could be due to inconsistent
and conflicting national guidelines. In addition, it was found that two pills,
instead of the recommended three pills, per dose of IPTp were frequently given to
pregnant women, a finding previously unreported.
CONCLUSION: To maximize IPTp coverage, sufficient and consistent supplies of SP
to both public and private health facilities are a necessity, combined with
effective communication of revised dosing schedules. Further research is
warranted to investigate the aberrant administration of two pills per dose, as it
may exacerbate drug resistance.

Is the existing knowledge and skills of health workers regarding eye care in
children sufficient to meet needs?

Kishiki E, Hogeweg M, Dieleman M, Lewallen S, Courtright P.

Kilimanjaro Centre for Community Ophthalmology, P.O. Box 2254, Moshi, Tanzania.

Although uncommon, childhood blindness is a major contributor to blind-person
years in Africa. Children with vision-related problems need urgent referral, but 
existing evidence suggests that there is delay in presentation. A pilot study in 
a random selection of government dispensaries in two districts of Kilimanjaro
Region, Tanzania, was conducted to assess the knowledge and skills of primary
healthcare workers regarding eye care needs of children. Questionnaires were
administered to 16 healthcare workers, and in-depth interviews were conducted
with 9 health workers and 2 key informants. Overall, 88% of workers recognised
cataract in a picture, 63% knew that it required surgery but only 50% realised
surgery was urgent. Only 38% recognised squint as needing referral and none
considered this urgent. Moreover, 38% could correctly suggest a cause of a large 
corneal scar and 44% of workers believed that children with albinism need to
attend schools for the blind. Poor knowledge of referral and treatment guidelines
are likely due to a number of factors, including inadequate training and the
rarity of childhood blindness. Primary eye care manuals should be reviewed to
ensure that information regarding childhood blindness is adequate and
appropriate. Referral pathways should also be revised.

Study Design:Literature ReviewBackground:We estimate that over 29 million people 
worldwide in resource-limited environments (RLEs) are in need of orthotic and
prosthetic (O&P) devices and services.Objectives:Our goal was to ascertain the
current state of O&P provision in RLEs and identify factors that may lead to more
successful O&P provision.Methods:We conducted a comprehensive scoping literature 
review of all information related to O&P provision in RLEs published from 2000 to
2010. We targeted Vietnam, Cambodia, Tanzania, Malawi, Colombia, and the Navajo
Nation, but also included information about developing countries in general. We
searched academic databases and grey literature. We extracted information from
each article in the areas of design, manufacturing, distribution, service
provision, and technology transfer.Results:We identified commonly reported
considerations and strategies for O&P provision from 431 articles. Analysis of
expert consensus documents revealed recurring themes for improving O&P provision.
We found that some suggestions from the consensus documents are being followed,
but many are overlooked or have not yet been implemented.Conclusions:Areas for
improvement include conducting field testing during the design process, providing
services to rural environments, offering follow-up services, considering
government collaboration, and encouraging an active role of the
orthosis/prosthesis user. Outcomes and research studies will be further discussed
in Part Two.

HIV/AIDS KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE AMONG WOMEN IN THE LEAST AND MOST
HIV/AIDS AFFECTED REGIONS OF MAINLAND TANZANIA.

Katapa RS, Rweyemamu DK.

* Department of Statistics, University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Summary Among women in mainland Tanzania, Iringa region in the southern highlands
has the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rate while Arusha region in the north-east
has the lowest prevalence rate. In a 2007/8 survey, Iringa's HIV rate for women
was 18.6% versus 0.8% in Arusha. Using data from a survey of women aged 15-49
years conducted in 2009 by the Champion project of EngenderHealth, a comparison
was made of HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitude and practice between women in Iringa and
Arusha regions. It was found that women in Arusha region had more knowledge of
HIV/AIDS than women in Iringa region, and that more than three-quarters of the
women in each region were married and 12% of the women in Arusha region had never
been married compared with 8% of the women in Iringa region. The majority of
women in each region had at least primary school education and there was no
significant difference between their educational levels. Women in Arusha region
were economically less active than women in Iringa region, a statistically
significant association. More women in Arusha region than in Iringa region had
never had children (24% versus 12%). Similarly, women in Arusha region had
significantly fewer children compared with women in Iringa.

Physical fighting among Egyptian adolescents: social and demographic correlates
among a nationally representative sample.

Celedonia KL, Wilson ML, El Gammal HA, Hagras AM.

Centre for Injury Prevention and Community Safety, PeerCorps Trust Fund , Dar es 
Salaam , Tanzania.

Introduction. Adolescent interpersonal violence is a global public health
problem, yet gaps remain in the epidemiologic literature on adolescent violence
in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Prevalence rates and risk and
protective factors reported in high-income countries may be different from those 
reported in LMICs. Culturally-relevant epidemiologic data is important in efforts
aimed at addressing adolescent interpersonal violence in these countries.
Methods. A cross-sectional study of Egyptian adolescent involvement in violent
behavior was conducted. Data collected from a 2006 school-based survey initiative
were used; participants were adolescents aged 11-17 (N = 5, 249). Some
participants were excluded from the dataset due to incomplete data (N = 111)
resulting in a final sample of 5,138. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses 
were run to determine demographic and social variables associated with
participation in physical fighting. Results. Thirty-one percent of adolescents
reported being involved in a physical fight. Previously reported risk factors for
violent behavior among adolescents such as depressive symptoms (OR = 1.29; CI =
1.11-1.50) and bullying victimization (OR = 2.44; CI = 2.12-2.83) were positively
associated with violent behavior in the present study, while the more novel
factor of sedentary behavior was also observed as having a positive association
with violent behavior (OR = 1.43; CI = 1.21-1.69). Known protective factors such 
as helpful peers (OR = 0.75; CI = 0.62-0.90) and understanding parents (OR =
0.67; CI = 0.56-0.81) were found to have negative associations with violent
behavior in the present study, in addition to the counterintuitive protective
effect of having fewer friends (OR = 0.75; CI = 0.60-0.92). Conclusions.
Prevalence rates of adolescent interpersonal violence in Egypt are similar to
rates in other LMICs. The high reported rates of depressive symptomatology and
bully victimization along with their positive association with physical fighting 
suggest that interventions aimed at treating and preventing these problems may
help mitigate the likelihood of adolescents engaging in violent behavior;
involvement in appropriate physical activity in a safe environment may be
beneficial as well. More research is needed to understand the observed protective
factor of having fewer friends.

The usefulness of rapid diagnostic tests in the new context of low malaria
transmission in Zanzibar.

Shakely D, Elfving K, Aydin-Schmidt B, Msellem MI, Morris U, Omar R, Weiping X,
Petzold M, Greenhouse B, Baltzell KA, Ali AS, BjÃ¶rkman A, MÃ¥rtensson A.

Malaria Research, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden ; Department of Medicine, KungÃ¤lv Hospital, KungÃ¤lv, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: We assessed if histidine-rich-protein-2 (HRP2) based rapid diagnostic
test (RDT) remains an efficient tool for Plasmodium falciparum case detection
among fever patients in Zanzibar and if primary health care workers continue to
adhere to RDT results in the new epidemiological context of low malaria
transmission. Further, we evaluated the performance of RDT within the newly
adopted integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) algorithm in Zanzibar.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 3890 patients aged â‰¥ 2 months with
uncomplicated febrile illness in this health facility based observational study
conducted in 12 primary health care facilities in Zanzibar, between May-July
2010. One patient had an inconclusive RDT result. Overall 121/3889 (3.1%)
patients were RDT positive. The highest RDT positivity rate, 32/528 (6.1%), was
found in children aged 5-14 years. RDT sensitivity and specificity against PCR
was 76.5% (95% CI 69.0-83.9%) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.7-100%), and against blood
smear microscopy 78.6% (95% CI 70.8-85.1%) and 99.7% (95% CI 99.6-99.9%),
respectively. All RDT positive, but only 3/3768 RDT negative patients received
anti-malarial treatment. Adherence to RDT results was thus 3887/3889 (99.9%). RDT
performed well in the IMCI algorithm with equally high adherence among children
<5 years as compared with other age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of HRP-2 based RDT in the hands of health care
workers compared with both PCR and microscopy for P. falciparum case detection
was relatively low, whereas adherence to test results with anti-malarial
treatment was excellent. Moreover, the results provide evidence that RDT can be
reliably integrated in IMCI as a tool for improved childhood fever management.
However, the relatively low RDT sensitivity highlights the need for improved
quality control of RDT use in primary health care facilities, but also for more
sensitive point-of-care malaria diagnostic tools in the new epidemiological
context of low malaria transmission in Zanzibar.

Measuring catch-up growth in malnourished populations.

Hirvonen K.

University of Sussex, Department of Economics , Brighton BN1 9RH , UK.

Abstract Background and aim: Numerous recent studies measure catch-up growth by
regressing adult or pre-adolescent height on early childhood height. Using simple
statistical theory and data from a healthy and well-nourished population, this
paper shows that these tests are uninformative about the extent of catch-up
growth. The study also provides new empirical evidence on pubertal catch-up
growth using longitudinal data for rural Tanzania. Subjects and methods: The 1970
British Cohort Study is used to demonstrate the flaws in the recent literature
using regression techniques to study catch-up growth. The data for the empirical 
analysis come from the Kagera Health and Development survey-a longitudinal study 
spanning two decades. The final sample includes 540 children whose heights are
measured in early childhood and in adulthood. Catch-up growth is measured as the 
change in height-for-age z-score over time. Results: The mean HAZ-score in the
cohort improves from -1.86 in early childhood to -1.20 in adulthood. Without
catch-up growth, children would have been 4.5-5 centimetres shorter adults.
Graphical analysis shows that most of this catch-up growth takes place in
puberty. Conclusion: Catch-up growth after early childhood is possible. Puberty
seems to offer an opportunity window for recovery.

Macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography findings in Tanzanian
endemic optic neuropathy.

Kisimbi J, Shalchi Z, Mahroo OA, Mhina C, Sanyiwa AJ, Mabey D, Mohamed M, Plant
GT.

1 Department of Ophthalmology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied
Sciences, Box 65001, Dar es Salaam,Tanzania.

Bilateral optic neuropathy in Dar es Salaam is now considered endemic and is
estimated to affect 0.3-2.4% of young adults. The condition is characterized by a
subacute bilateral loss of central vision of unknown aetiology. Findings of
spectral domain optical coherence tomography have not previously been reported
for these patients. All patients diagnosed with endemic optic neuropathy over a
2-year period at the Muhimbili National Hospital underwent spectral domain
optical coherence tomography macular imaging. Scans were graded qualitatively for
severity of retinal nerve fibre layer loss as well as the presence of microcystic
macular changes, which have not previously been described in this condition. Of
the 128 patients included (54.7% male; median age 20 years), severe retinal nerve
fibre layer loss was found in 185 eyes (74.0%). There was full concordance in
retinal nerve fibre layer thickness between the two eyes in 113 (91.1%) patients.
Microcystic macular spaces were found in 16 (12.5%) patients and were bilateral
in nine (7.0%) individuals. These changes were typically more prominent in the
nasal than the temporal macula, predominantly involving the inner nuclear layer, 
and often occurred in an annular configuration that was evident on en face
infra-red imaging, though not discernible on colour fundus photography or
clinically. All patients with microcystic macular changes had severe thinning of 
the retinal nerve fibre layer (P = 0.02). Four patients in whom cystic spaces
were demonstrated had sequential scans, and there was no detectable alteration in
the configuration of these changes over a period of up to 16 months. This is the 
first study to document optical coherence tomography findings in endemic optic
neuropathy. We have observed symmetrical severe loss of the caeco-central
projection (papillomacular bundle) with otherwise well-preserved macular
architecture. Also, we have observed microcystic retinal changes in a significant
proportion of patients, which were associated with severe retinal nerve fibre
layer loss. Similar changes have recently been reported from optical coherence
tomography images of patients with multiple sclerosis, relapsing isolated optic
neuritis, dominant optic atrophy, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and a
patient with a chronic compressive optic neuropathy, supporting the hypothesis
that this may be a non-specific phenomenon secondary to ganglion cell death. The 
correspondence of the changes to an annulus discernible on infra-red en face
imaging, but not using other conventional retinal imaging techniques highlights
the potential usefulness of this modality.

New data regarding distribution of cattle ticks in the south-western Indian Ocean
islands.

Stachurski F, Tortosa P, Rahajarison P, Jacquet S, Yssouf A, Huber K.

: Recent studies have produced new insight into the origin and distribution of
some cattle ticks in the south-western Indian Ocean islands. Rhipicephalus
appendiculatus, introduced from Tanzania in 2002, is now well established on
Grande Comore but has not yet reached the other islands of the archipelago
(Moheli, Anjouan and Mayotte). Only one of the two clades identified in Africa
has settled so far. Amblyomma variegatum, which was not supposed to be able to
persist in the Antananarivo region (1300 m) nor in other Malagasy regions of high
altitude without regular introductions of ticks by infested cattle, is now
endemic as a general rule up to 1600 m although other regions of lower altitude
(1400 m) are still free of the tick. This species remains confined in a small
area of the west coast on La Reunion Island. On the contrary, Hyalomma dromedarii
could not settle on Madagascar where it was introduced in 2008 and Rhipicephalus 
evertsi evertsi is not yet present in Grande Comore despite regular introductions
by infested cattle from Tanzania. A phylogeographic approach has been carried out
at an intra-specific level for A. variegatum. This study has led to the
identification of two main lineages, one covering all species distribution and
one restricted to East Africa and the Indian Ocean area. These two lineages are
in sympatry in Madagascar where a high genetic diversity has been described,
whereas a lower genetic diversity is observed on other islands. These results
seem to agree with the historical data concerning the introduction of the tick in
the Indian Ocean area.

Evolutionary history of the grey-faced Sengi, Rhynchocyon udzungwensis, from
Tanzania: a molecular and species distribution modelling approach.

Lawson LP, Vernesi C, Ricci S, Rovero F.

Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio,
United States of America.

Rhynchocyon udzungwensis is a recently described and poorly understood sengi
(giant elephant-shrew) endemic to two small montane forests in Southern Tanzania,
and surrounded in lower forests by R. cirnei reichardi. In this study, we
investigate the molecular genetic relationship between R. udzungwensis and R. c. 
reichardi, and the possible role that shifting species distributions in response 
to climate fluctuations may have played in shaping their evolutionary history.
Rhynchocyon udzungwensis and R. c. reichardi individuals were sampled from five
localities for genetic analyses. Three mitochondrial and two nuclear loci were
used to construct species trees for delimitation and to determine whether
introgression was detectable either from ancient or ongoing hybridization. All
species-tree results show R. udzungwensis and R. c. reichardi as distinct
lineages, though mtDNA shows evidence of introgression in some populations.
Nuclear loci of each species were monophyletic, implying introgression is
exclusively historical. Because we found evidence of introgression, we used
distribution data and species distribution modelling for present, glacial, and
interglacial climate cycles to predict how shifting species distributions may
have facilitated hybridization in some populations. Though interpretations are
affected by the limited range of these species, a likely scenario is that the
mtDNA introgression found in eastern mid-elevation populations was facilitated by
low numbers of R. udzungwensis that expanded into lowland heavily occupied R. c. 
reichardi areas during interglacial climate cycles. These results imply that
relationships within the genus Rhynchocyon may be confounded by porous species
boundaries and introgression, even if species are not currently sympatric.

While male circumcision reduces the risk of female-to-male HIV transmission and
certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs), there is little evidence that
circumcision provides women with direct protection against HIV. This study used
qualitative methods to assess women's perceptions of male circumcision in Iringa,
Tanzania. Women in this study had strong preferences for circumcised men because 
of the low risk perception of HIV with circumcised men, social norms favoring
circumcised men, and perceived increased sexual desirability of circumcised men. 
The health benefits of male circumcision were generally overstated; many
respondents falsely believed that women are also directly protected against HIV
and that the risk of all STIs is greatly reduced or eliminated in circumcised
men. Efforts to engage women about the risks and limitations of male
circumcision, in addition to the benefits, should be expanded so that women can
accurately assess their risk of HIV or STIs during sexual intercourse with
circumcised men.

SUMMARY We assessed the role of tuberculosis (TB) disease and HIV infection on
the level of physical activity. A combined heart rate and movement sensor was
used to assess habitual physical activity in TB patients and non-TB controls. The
association between sputum-negative TB, sputum-positive TB, HIV and physical
activity estimates were assessed in multivariable linear regression models
adjusted for age, sex, haemoglobin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP).
Sputum-positive [eB 0·43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·29-0·64] and
sputum-negative (eB 0·67, 95% CI 0·47-0·94) TB as well as HIV infection (eB 0·59,
95% CI 0·46-0·75) were associated with reduced activity compared to controls.
Anaemia accounted for a substantial part of the effects of HIV, while elevated
AGP primarily mediated the TB effect. The level of physical activity is highly
influenced by TB and HIV, and mainly mediated through anaemia of infection and
associated with elevated acute phase response.

District health managers' perceptions of supervision in Malawi and Tanzania.

Bradley S, Kamwendo F, Masanja H, de Pinho H, Waxman R, Boostrom C, McAuliffe E.

BACKGROUND: Mid-level cadres are being used to address human resource shortages
in many African contexts, but insufficient and ineffective human resource
management is compromising their performance. Supervision plays a key role in
performance and motivation, but is frequently characterised by periodic
inspection and control, rather than support and feedback to improve performance. 
This paper explores the perceptions of district health management teams in
Tanzania and Malawi on their role as supervisors and on the challenges to
effective supervision at the district level.
METHODS: This qualitative study took place as part of a broader project, "Health 
Systems Strengthening for Equity: The Power and Potential of Mid-Level
Providers". Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 district health
management team personnel in Malawi and 37 council health team members in
Tanzania. The interviews covered a range of human resource management issues,
including supervision and performance assessment, staff job descriptions and
roles, motivation and working conditions.
RESULTS: Participants displayed varying attitudes to the nature and purpose of
the supervision process. Much of the discourse in Malawi centred on inspection
and control, while interviewees in Tanzania were more likely to articulate a
paradigm characterised by support and improvement. In both countries, facility
level performance metrics dominated. The lack of competency-based indicators or
clear standards to assess individual health worker performance were considered
problematic. Shortages of staff, at both district and facility level, were
described as a major impediment to carrying out regular supervisory visits. Other
challenges included conflicting and multiple responsibilities of district health 
team staff and financial constraints.
CONCLUSION: Supervision is a central component of effective human resource
management. Policy level attention is crucial to ensure a systematic, structured 
process that is based on common understandings of the role and purpose of
supervision. This is particularly important in a context where the majority of
staff are mid-level cadres for whom regulation and guidelines may not be as
formalised or well-developed as for traditional cadres, such as registered nurses
and medical doctors. Supervision needs to be adequately resourced and supported
in order to improve performance and retention at the district level.

Do accurate HIV and antiretroviral therapy knowledge, and previous testing
experiences increase the uptake of HIV voluntary counselling and testing? results
from a cohort study in rural Tanzania.

South A, Wringe A, Kumogola Y, Isingo R, Manyalla R, Cawley C, Zaba B, Todd J,
Urassa M.

BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of free antiretroviral therapy (ART), the
use of voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services remains persistently low 
in many African countries. This study investigates how prior experience of HIV
and VCT, and knowledge about HIV and ART influence VCT use in rural Tanzania.
METHODS: In 2006--7, VCT was offered to study participants during the fifth
survey round of an HIV community cohort study that includes HIV testing for
research purposes without results disclosure, and a questionnaire covering
knowledge, attitudes and practices around HIV infection and HIV services.
Categorical variables were created for HIV knowledge and ART knowledge, with
"good" HIV and ART knowledge defined as correctly answering at least 4/6 and 5/7 
questions about HIV and ART respectively. Experience of HIV was defined as
knowing people living with HIV, or having died from AIDS. Logistic regression
methods were used to assess how HIV and ART knowledge, and prior experiences of
HIV and VCT were associated with VCT uptake, with adjustment for HIV status and
socio-demographic confounders.
RESULTS: 2,695/3,886 (69%) men and 2,708/5,575 women (49%) had "good" HIV
knowledge, while 613/3,886 (16%) men and 585/5575 (10%) women had "good" ART
knowledge. Misconceptions about HIV transmission were common, including through
kissing (55% of women, 43% of men), or mosquito bites (42% of women, 34% of
men).19% of men and 16% of women used VCT during the survey. After controlling
for HIV status and socio-demographic factors, the odds of VCT use were lower
among those with poor HIV knowledge (aOR:0.5; p = 0.01 for men and aOR = 0.6; p <
0.01 for women) and poor ART knowledge (aOR:0.8; p = 0.06 for men, aOR:0.8; p <
0.01 for women), and higher among those with HIV experience (aOR:1.3 for men and 
aOR = 1.6 for women, p < 0.01) and positive prior VCT experience (aOR:2.0 for all
men and aOR = 2.0 for HIV-negative women only, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Two years after the introduction of free ART in this setting,
misconceptions regarding HIV transmission remain rife and knowledge regarding
treatment is worryingly poor, especially among women and HIV-positive people.
Further HIV-related information, education and communication activities are
urgently needed to improve VCT uptake in rural Tanzania.

The economic costs of malaria in children in three sub-Saharan countries: Ghana, 
Tanzania and Kenya.

Sicuri E, Vieta A, Lindner L, Constenla D, Sauboin C.

BACKGROUND: Malaria causes significant mortality and morbidity in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA), especially among children less than five years of age (U5
children). Although the economic burden of malaria in this region has been
assessed previously, the extent and variation of this burden remains unclear.
This study aimed to estimate the economic costs of malaria in U5 children in
three countries (Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya).
METHODS: Health system and household costs previously estimated were integrated
with costs associated with co-morbidities, complications and productivity losses 
due to death. Several models were developed to estimate the expected treatment
cost per episode per child, across different age groups, by level of severity and
with or without controlling for treatment-seeking behaviour. Total annual costs
(2009) were calculated by multiplying the treatment cost per episode according to
severity by the number of episodes. Annual health system prevention costs were
added to this estimate.
RESULTS: Household and health system costs per malaria episode ranged from
approximately US$5 for non-complicated malaria in Tanzania to US$288 for cerebral
malaria with neurological sequelae in Kenya. On average, up to 55% of these costs
in Ghana and Tanzania and 70% in Kenya were assumed by the household, and of
these costs 46% in Ghana and 85% in Tanzania and Kenya were indirect costs.
Expected values of potential future earnings (in thousands) lost due to premature
death of children aged 0--1 and 1--4 years were US$11.8 and US$13.8 in Ghana,
US$6.9 and US$8.1 in Tanzania, and US$7.6 and US$8.9 in Kenya, respectively. The 
expected treatment costs per episode per child ranged from a minimum of US$1.29
for children aged 2--11 months in Tanzania to a maximum of US$22.9 for children
aged 0--24 months in Kenya. The total annual costs (in millions) were estimated
at US$37.8, US$131.9 and US$109.0 nationwide in Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya and
included average treatment costs per case of US$11.99, US$6.79 and US$20.54,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study provides important insight into the economic burden of
malaria in SSA that may assist policy makers when designing future malaria
control interventions.

Smallholder Farms as Stepping Stone Corridors for Crop-Raiding Elephant in
Northern Tanzania: Integration of Bayesian Expert System and Network Simulator.

Department of Natural Resources, Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth
Observation (ITC), University of Twente, P.O. Box 217, 7500 AE, Enschede, The
Netherlands, pittiglio@itc.nl.

Crop-raiding elephants affect local livelihoods, undermining conservation
efforts. Yet, crop-raiding patterns are poorly understood, making prediction and 
protection difficult. We hypothesized that raiding elephants use corridors
between daytime refuges and farmland. Elephant counts, crop-raiding records,
household surveys, Bayesian expert system, and least-cost path simulation were
used to predict four alternative categories of daily corridors: (1) footpaths,
(2) dry river beds, (3) stepping stones along scattered small farms, and (4)
trajectories of shortest distance to refuges. The corridor alignments were
compared in terms of their minimum cumulative resistance to elephant movement and
related to crop-raiding zones quantified by a kernel density function. The
"stepping stone" corridors predicted the crop-raiding patterns. Elephant presence
was confirmed along these corridors, demonstrating that small farms located
between refuges and contiguous farmland increase habitat connectivity for
elephant. Our analysis successfully predicted elephant occurrence in farmland
where daytime counts failed to detect nocturnal presence. These results have
conservation management implications.

workforce performance? A research protocol.

INTRODUCTION: The single biggest barrier for countries in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) to scale up the necessary health services for addressing the three
health-related Millennium Development Goals and achieving Universal Health
Coverage is the lack of an adequate and well-performing health workforce. This
deficit needs to be addressed both by training more new health personnel and by
improving the performance of the existing and future health workforce. However,
efforts have mostly been focused on training new staff and less on improving the 
performance of the existing health workforce. The purpose of this paper is to
disseminate the protocol for the PERFORM project and reflect on the key
challenges encountered during the development of this methodology and how they
are being overcome.
METHODS: The overall aim of the PERFORM project is to identify ways of
strengthening district management in order to address health workforce
inadequacies by improving health workforce performance in SSA. The study will
take place in three districts each in Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda using an action 
research approach. With the support of the country research teams, the district
health management teams (DHMTs) will lead on planning, implementation,
observation, reflection and redefinition of the activities in the study. Taking
into account the national and local human resource (HR) and health systems (HS)
policies and practices already in place, 'bundles' of HR/HS strategies that are
feasible within the context and affordable within the districts' budget will be
developed by the DHMTs to strengthen priority areas of health workforce
performance. A comparative analysis of the findings from the three districts in
each country will add new knowledge on the effects of these HR/HS bundles on DHMT
management and workforce performance and the impact of an action research
approach on improving the effectiveness of the DHMTs in implementing these
interventions.
DISCUSSION: Different challenges were faced during the development of the
methodology. These include the changing context in the study districts, competing
with other projects and duties for the time of district managers, complexity of
the study design, maintaining the anonymity and confidentiality of study
participants as well as how to record the processes during the study. We also
discuss how these challenges are being addressed. The dissemination of this
research protocol is intended to generate interest in the PERFORM project and
also stimulate discussion on the use of action research in complex studies such
as this on strengthening district health management to improve health workforce
performance.

Challenges to the implementation of health sector decentralization in Tanzania:
experiences from Kongwa district council.

BACKGROUND: During the 1990s, the government of Tanzania introduced the
decentralization by devolution (D by D) approach involving the transfer of
functions, power and authority from the centre to the local government
authorities (LGAs) to improve the delivery of public goods and services,
including health services.
OBJECTIVE: This article examines and documents the experiences facing the
implementation of decentralization of health services from the perspective of
national and district officials.
DESIGN: The study adopted a qualitative approach, and data were collected using
semi-structured interviews and were analysed for themes and patterns.
RESULTS: The results showed several benefits of decentralization, including
increased autonomy in local resource mobilization and utilization, an enhanced
bottom-up planning approach, increased health workers' accountability and
reduction of bureaucratic procedures in decision making. The findings also
revealed several challenges which hinder the effective functioning of
decentralization. These include inadequate funding, untimely disbursement of
funds from the central government, insufficient and unqualified personnel, lack
of community participation in planning and political interference.
CONCLUSION: The article concludes that the central government needs to adhere to 
the principles that established the local authorities and grant more autonomy to 
them, offer special incentives to staff working in the rural areas and create the
capacity for local key actors to participate effectively in the planning process.

* Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth , Lebanon, New Hampshire , USA.

Abstract Objective: Our objective was to obtain reliable threshold measurements
without a sound booth by using a passive noise-attenuating hearing protector
combined with in-ear 1/3-octave band noise measurements to verify the ear canal
was suitably quiet. Design: We deployed laptop-based hearing testing systems to
Tanzania as part of a study of HIV infection and hearing. An in-ear probe
containing a microphone was used under the hearing protector for both the in-ear 
noise measurements and threshold audiometry. The 1/3-octave band noise spectrum
from the microphone was displayed on the operator's screen with acceptable levels
in grey and unacceptable levels in red. Operators attempted to make all bars
grey, but focused on achieving grey bars at 2000 Hz and above. Study sample: 624 
adults and 197 children provided 3381 in-ear octave band measurements. Repeated
measurements from 144 individuals who returned for testing on three separate
occasions were also analysed. Results: In-ear noise levels exceeded the maximum
permissible ambient noise levels (MPANL) for ears not covered, but not the dB SPL
levels corresponding to 0 dB HL between 2000-4000 Hz. In-ear noise measurements
were repeatable over time. Conclusions: Reliable audiometry can be performed
using a passive noise-attenuating hearing protector and in-ear noise
measurements.

Costs of inaction on maternal mortality: qualitative evidence of the impacts of
maternal deaths on living children in Tanzania.

Massachusetts, United States of America ; Program on the Health Rights of Women
and Children, FranÏ‚ois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, Harvard
University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the interconnectedness of maternal deaths and
impacts on children, beyond infants, or the mechanisms through which this
interconnectedness is established. A study was conducted in rural Tanzania to
provide qualitative insight regarding how maternal mortality affects index as
well as other living children and to identify shared structural and social
factors that foster high levels of maternal mortality and child vulnerabilities.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult family members of women who died due to maternal
causes (N = 45) and key stakeholders (N = 35) participated in in-depth
interviews. Twelve focus group discussions were also conducted (N = 83) among
community leaders in three rural regions of Tanzania. Findings highlight the
widespread impact of a woman's death on her children's health, education, and
economic status, and, by inference, the roles that women play within their
families in rural Tanzanian communities.
CONCLUSIONS: The full costs of failing to address preventable maternal mortality 
include intergenerational impacts on the nutritional status, health, and
education of children, as well as the economic capacity of families. When setting
priorities in a resource-poor, high maternal mortality country, such as Tanzania,
the far-reaching effects that reducing maternal deaths can have on families and
communities, as well as women's own lives, should be considered.

Recurrence of perinatal death in Northern Tanzania: a registry based cohort
study.

Mahande MJ, Daltveit AK, Mmbaga BT, Obure J, Masenga G, Manongi R, Lie RT.

BACKGROUND: Perinatal mortality is known to be high in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some
women may carry a particularly high risk which would be reflected in a high
recurrence risk. We aim to estimate the recurrence risk of perinatal death using 
data from a hospital in Northern Tanzania.
METHODS: We constructed a cohort study using data from the hospital based KCMC
Medical Birth Registry. Women who delivered a singleton for the first time at the
hospital between 2000 and 2008 were followed in the registry for subsequent
deliveries up to 2010 and 3,909 women were identified with at least one more
delivery within the follow-up period. Recurrence risk of perinatal death was
estimated in multivariate models analysis while adjusting for confounders and
accounting for correlation between births from the same mother.
RESULTS: The recurrence risk of perinatal death for women who had lost a previous
baby was 9.1%. This amounted to a relative risk of 3.2 (95% CI: 2.2 - 4.7)
compared to the much lower risk of 2.8% for women who had had a surviving baby.
Recurrence contributed 21.2% (31/146) of perinatal deaths in subsequent
pregnancies. Preeclampsia, placental abruption, placenta previa, induced labor,
preterm delivery and low birth weight in a previous delivery with a surviving
baby were also associated with increased perinatal mortality in the next
pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Some women in Tanzanian who suffer a perinatal loss in one pregnancy
are at a particularly high risk of also losing the baby of a subsequent
pregnancy. Strategies of perinatal death prevention that target pregnant women
who are particularly vulnerable or already have experienced a perinatal loss
should be considered in future research.

Mosquito larval source management for controlling malaria.

Tusting LS, Thwing J, Sinclair D, Fillinger U, Gimnig J, Bonner KE, Bottomley C, 
Lindsay SW.

Department of Disease Control, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
London, UK.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is an important cause of illness and death in people living
in many parts of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa.Â Long-lasting
insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) reduce
malaria transmission by targeting the adult mosquito vector and are key
components of malaria control programmes. However, mosquito numbers may also be
reducedÂ by larval source management (LSM), which targetsÂ mosquito larvae as they 
mature in aquatic habitats. This is conducted by permanently or temporarily
reducing the availability of larval habitats (habitat modification and habitat
manipulation), orÂ by adding substancesÂ to standing waterÂ that either kill or
inhibit the development of larvae (larviciding).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of mosquito LSM for preventing malaria.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized
Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE;
EMBASE; CABS Abstracts; and LILACS up to 24 October 2012.Â We handsearched the
Tropical Diseases Bulletin from 1900 to 2010, the archives of the World Health
Organization (up to 11 February 2011), and the literature database of the Armed
Forces Pest Management Board (up to 2 March 2011). We also contacted colleagues
in the field for relevant articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included cluster randomized controlled trials
(cluster-RCTs), controlled before-and-after trials with at least one year of
baseline data, and randomized cross-over trials that compared LSM with no LSM for
malaria control. We excluded trials that evaluated biological control of
anopheline mosquitoes with larvivorous fish.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors assessed each trial for
eligibility. We extracted data and at least two authors independently determined 
the risk of bias in the included studies. We resolved all disagreements through
discussion with a third author. We analyzed the data using Review Manager 5
software.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies; four cluster-RCTs, eight controlled
before-and-after trials, and one randomized cross-over trial. The included
studies evaluated habitat modification (one study), habitat modification with
larviciding (two studies), habitat manipulation (one study), habitat manipulation
plus larviciding (two studies), or larviciding alone (seven studies) in a wide
variety of habitats and countries. Malaria incidenceIn two cluster-RCTs
undertaken in Sri Lanka, larviciding of abandoned mines, streams, irrigation
ditches, and rice paddies reduced malaria incidence by around three-quarters
compared to the control (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.31, 20,124 participants, two
trials, moderate quality evidence). In three controlled before-and-after trials
in urban and rural India and rural Kenya, results were inconsistent (98,233
participants, three trials, very low quality evidence). In one trial in urban
India, the removal of domestic water containers together with weekly larviciding 
of canals and stagnant pools reduced malaria incidence by three quarters. In one 
trial in rural India and one trial in rural Kenya, malaria incidence was higher
at baseline in intervention areas than in controls. However dam construction in
India, and larviciding of streams and swamps in Kenya, reduced malaria incidence 
to levels similar to the control areas. In one additional randomized cross-over
trial in the flood plains of the Gambia River, where larval habitats were
extensive and ill-defined, larviciding by ground teams did not result in a
statistically significant reduction in malaria incidence (2039 participants, one 
trial). Parasite prevalenceIn one cluster-RCT from Sri Lanka, larviciding reduced
parasite prevalence by almost 90% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.22, 2963
participants, one trial, moderate quality evidence). In five controlled
before-and-after trials in Greece, India, the Philippines, and Tanzania, LSM
resulted in an average reduction in parasite prevalence of around two-thirds (RR 
0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.55, 8041 participants, five trials, moderate quality
evidence). The interventions in these five trials included dam construction to
reduce larval habitats, flushing of streams, removal of domestic water
containers, and larviciding. In the randomized cross-over trial in the flood
plains of the Gambia River, larviciding by ground teams did not significantly
reduce parasite prevalence (2039 participants, one trial).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In Africa and Asia, LSM is another policy option, alongside
LLINs and IRS, for reducing malaria morbidity in both urban and rural areas where
a sufficient proportion of larval habitats can be targeted. Further research is
needed to evaluate whether LSM is appropriate or feasible in parts of rural
Africa where larval habitats are more extensive.

A qualitative study of perceived risk for HIV transmission among police officers 
in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Tarimo EA, Kohi TW, Bakari M, Kulane A.

BACKGROUND: Understanding people's views about HIV transmission by investigating 
a specific population may help to design effective HIV prevention strategies. In 
addition, knowing the inherent sexual practices of such a population, as well as 
the risky circumstances that may facilitate HIV transmission, is crucial for the 
said strategies to become effective. In this article, we report how police
officers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, perceived the problem of HIV and AIDS in
their local context, particularly in relation to unsafe sexual practices. The
study was done with the view to recommending ways by which HIV transmission could
be minimised within the police force.
METHODS: The study was conducted among members of the police force in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. Eight focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted, with a
total of 66 participants who were mixed in terms of age, gender, and marital
status. Some of these were caregivers to patients with AIDS. Data were analysed
using the interpretive description approach.
RESULTS: The participants believed that both individual sexual behaviour and
work-related circumstances were sources of HIV infection. They also admitted that
they were being tempted to engage in risky sexual practices because of the
institutional rules that prohibit officers from getting married during their
training and for three years after. Nevertheless, as members of the Police Force,
they stressed the fact that the risky sexual behaviour that exposes them to HIV
is not limited to the force; it is rather a common problem that is faced by the
general population. However, they complained, the nature of their job exposes
them to road accident victims, subjecting them further to possible infection,
especially when they have to handle these road accident casualties without proper
protective gear.
CONCLUSION: Individual sexual behaviour and job-related circumstances are worth
investigating if proper advice is to be given to the police regarding HIV
prevention strategies. In order to improve the lives of these police officers,
there is a need to review the existing institutional rules and practices to
accommodate individual sexual needs. In addition, improving their working
environment may minimize the risk of HIV transmission from handling casualties in
emergency situations.

Breadth of Anti-Merozoite Antibody Responses Is Associated With the Genetic
Diversity of Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum Infections and Protection Against
Clinical Malaria.

Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet,
Stockholm, Sweden.

Background.â€ƒElucidating the mechanisms of naturally acquired immunity to
Plasmodium falciparum infections would be highly valuable for malaria vaccine
development. Asymptomatic multiclonal infections have been shown to predict
protection from clinical malaria in a transmission-dependent manner, but the
mechanisms underlying this are unclear. We assessed the breadth of antibody
responses to several vaccine candidate merozoite antigens in relation to the
infecting parasite population and clinical immunity. Methods.â€ƒIn a cohort study
in Tanzania, 320 children aged 1-16 years who were asymptomatic at baseline were 
included. We genotyped P. falciparum infections by targeting the msp2 gene using 
polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis and measured antibodies
to 7 merozoite antigens using a multiplex assay. We assessed the correlation
between the number of clones and the breadth of the antibody response, and
examined their effects on the risk of malaria during 40 weeks of follow-up using 
age-adjusted multivariate regression models. Results.â€ƒThe antibody breadth was
positively correlated with the number of clones (RR [risk ratio], 1.63; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.02). Multiclonal infections were associated with
a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of malaria in the absence of antibodies
(RR, 0.83; 95% CI, .29-2.34). The breadth of the antibody response was
significantly associated with a reduced risk of malaria in the absence of
infections (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, .09-.66). In combination, these factors were
associated with a lower risk of malaria than they were individually (RR, 0.14;
95% CI, .04-.48). Conclusions.â€ƒThese data suggest that malaria vaccines mimicking
naturally acquired immunity should ideally induce antibody responses that can be 
boosted by natural infections.

Mechanisms of post-supply contamination of drinking water in Bagamoyo, Tanzania.

Harris AR, Davis J, Boehm AB.

Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford,
CA 94305, USA. angelaharris@stanford.edu

Access to household water connections remains low in sub-Saharan Africa,
representing a public health concern. Previous studies have shown water stored in
the home to be more contaminated than water at the source; however, the
mechanisms of post-supply contamination remain unclear. Using water quality
measurements and structured observations of households in Bagamoyo, Tanzania,
this study elucidates the causal mechanisms of the microbial contamination of
drinking water after collection from a communal water source. The study
identifies statistically significant loadings of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB)
occurring immediately after filling the storage container at the source and after
extraction of the water from the container in the home. Statistically significant
loadings of FIB also occur with various water extraction methods, including
decanting from the container and use of a cup or ladle. Additionally, pathogenic 
genes of Escherichia coli were detected in stored drinking water but not in the
source from which it was collected, highlighting the potential health risks of
post-supply contamination. The results of the study confirm that storage
containers and extraction utensils introduce microbial contamination into stored 
drinking water, and suggest that further research is needed to identify methods
of water extraction that prevent microbial contamination of drinking water.

Using electronic technology to improve clinical care -- results from a
before-after cluster trial to evaluate assessment and classification of sick
children according to Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) protocol 
in Tanzania.

Mitchell M, Hedt-Gauthier BL, Msellemu D, Nkaka M, Lesh N.

BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness
(IMCI) protocol reduces the potential impact on under-five morbidity and
mortality. Electronic technology could improve adherence; however there are few
studies demonstrating the benefits of such technology in a resource-poor
settings. This study estimates the impact of electronic technology on adherence
to the IMCI protocols as compared to the current paper-based protocols in
Tanzania.
METHODS: In four districts in Tanzania, 18 clinics were randomly selected for
inclusion. At each site, observers documented critical parts of the clinical
assessment of children aged 2 months to 5 years. The first set of observations
occurred during examination of children using paper-based IMCI (pIMCI) and the
next set of observations occurred during examination using the electronic IMCI
(eIMCI). Children were re-examined by an IMCI expert and the diagnoses were
compared. A total of 1221 children (671 paper, 550 electronic) were observed.
RESULTS: For all ten critical IMCI items included in both systems, adherence to
the protocol was greater for eIMCI than for pIMCI. The proportion assessed under 
pIMCI ranged from 61% to 98% compared to 92% to 100% under eIMCI (p < 0.05 for
each of the ten assessment items).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of electronic systems improved the completeness of assessment of
children with acute illness in Tanzania. With the before-after nature of the
design, potential for temporal confounding is the primary limitation. However,
the data collection for both phases occurred over a short period (one month) and 
so temporal confounding was expected to be minimal. The results suggest that the 
use of electronic IMCI protocols can improve the completeness and consistency of 
clinical assessments and future studies will examine the long-term health and
health systems impact of eIMCI.

Malaria diagnosis and treatment practices following introduction of rapid
diagnostic tests in Kibaha District, Coast Region, Tanzania.

Department of Medicine, Malaria Research, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden. mubimarycelina@yahoo.co.uk

BACKGROUND: The success of the universal parasite-based malaria testing policy
for fever patients attending primary health care (PHC) facilities in Tanzania
will depend highly on health workers' perceptions and practices. The aim of this 
study was, therefore, to assess the present use of malaria diagnostics (rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs) and microscopy), prescription behaviour and factors
affecting adherence to test results at PHC facilities in Kibaha District, Coast
Region, Tanzania.
METHODS: Exit interviews were conducted with fever patients at PHC facilities and
information on diagnostic test performed and treatment prescribed were recorded. 
Interviews with prescribers to assess their understanding, perceptions and
practices related to RDTs were conducted, and health facility inventory performed
to assess availability of staff, diagnostics and anti-malarial drugs.
RESULTS: The survey was undertaken at ten governmental PHC facilities, eight of
which had functional diagnostics. Twenty health workers were interviewed and 195 
exit interviews were conducted with patients at the PHC facilities. Of the 168
patients seen at facilities with available diagnostics, 105 (63%) were tested for
malaria, 31 (30%) of whom tested positive. Anti-malarial drugs were prescribed to
all patients with positive test results, 14% of patients with negative results
and 28% of patients not tested for malaria. Antibiotics were more likely to be
prescribed to patients with negative test results compared to patients with
positive results (81 vs 39%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and among non-tested compared to those
tested for malaria (84 vs 69%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Stock-outs of RDTs and staff shortage
accounted for the low testing rate, and health worker perceptions were the main
reason for non-adherence to test results.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-malarial prescription to patients with negative test results
and those not tested is still practiced in Tanzania despite the universal malaria
testing policy of fever patients. The use of malaria diagnostics was also
associated with higher prescription of antibiotics among patients with negative
results. Strategies to address health system factors and health worker
perceptions associated with these practices are needed.

Impact of community-based larviciding on the prevalence of malaria infection in
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Maheu-Giroux M, Castro MC.

Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health,
Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: The use of larval source management is not prioritized by
contemporary malaria control programs in sub-Saharan Africa despite historical
success. Larviciding, in particular, could be effective in urban areas where
transmission is focal and accessibility to Anopheles breeding habitats is
generally easier than in rural settings. The objective of this study is to assess
the effectiveness of a community-based microbial larviciding intervention to
reduce the prevalence of malaria infection in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of
Tanzania.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Larviciding was implemented in 3 out of 15 targeted wards
of Dar es Salaam in 2006 after two years of baseline data collection. This
intervention was subsequently scaled up to 9 wards a year later, and to all 15
targeted wards in 2008. Continuous randomized cluster sampling of malaria
prevalence and socio-demographic characteristics was carried out during 6 survey 
rounds (2004-2008), which included both cross-sectional and longitudinal data
(Nâ€Š=â€Š64,537). Bayesian random effects logistic regression models were used to
quantify the effect of the intervention on malaria prevalence at the individual
level. Effect size estimates suggest a significant protective effect of the
larviciding intervention. After adjustment for confounders, the odds of
individuals living in areas treated with larviciding being infected with malaria 
were 21% lower (Odds Ratioâ€Š=â€Š0.79; 95% Credible Intervals: 0.66-0.93) than those 
who lived in areas not treated. The larviciding intervention was most effective
during dry seasons and had synergistic effects with other protective measures
such as use of insecticide-treated bed nets and house proofing (i.e., complete
ceiling or window screens).
CONCLUSION: A large-scale community-based larviciding intervention significantly 
reduced the prevalence of malaria infection in urban Dar es Salaam.

INTRODUCTION: Cash payments to vulnerable households and/or individuals have
increasingly garnered attention as a means to reduce poverty, improve health and 
achieve other development-related outcomes. Recent evidence from Malawi and
Tanzania suggests that cash transfers can impact HIV-related behaviours and
outcomes and, therefore, could serve as an important addition to HIV prevention
efforts.
DISCUSSION: This article reviews the current evidence on cash transfers for HIV
prevention and suggests unresolved questions for further research. Gaps include
(1) understanding more about the mechanisms and pathways through which cash
transfers affect HIV-related outcomes; (2) addressing key operational questions, 
including the potential feasibility and the costs and benefits of different
models of transfers and conditionality; and (3) evaluating and enhancing the
wider impacts of cash transfers on health and development.
CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing and future studies should build on current findings to
unpack unresolved questions and to collect additional evidence on the multiple
impacts of transfers in different settings. Furthermore, in order to address
questions on sustainability, cash transfer programmes need to be integrated with 
other sectors and programmes that address structural factors such as education
and programming to promote gender equality and address HIV.

Plasmodium falciparum mutant haplotype infection during pregnancy associated with
reduced birthweight, Tanzania.

Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
(IPTp-SP) is a key strategy in the control of pregnancy-associated malaria.
However, this strategy is compromised by widespread drug resistance from
single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate
reductase and dihydropteroate synthetase genes. During September 2008-October
2010, we monitored a cohort of 924 pregnant women in an area of Tanzania with
declining malaria transmission. P. falciparum parasites were genotyped, and the
effect of infecting haplotypes on birthweight was assessed. Of the genotyped
parasites, 9.3%, 46.3%, and 44.4% had quadruple or less, quintuple, and sextuple 
mutated haplotypes, respectively. Mutant haplotypes were unrelated to SP doses.
Compared with infections with the less-mutated haplotypes, infections with the
sextuple haplotype mutation were associated with lower (359 g) birthweights.
Continued use of the suboptimal IPTp-SP regimen should be reevaluated, and
alternative strategies (e.g., intermittent screening and treatment or
intermittent treatment with safe and effective alternative drugs) should be
evaluated.

Prevalence and type distribution of human papillomavirus among 1813 men in
Tanzania and the relationship to HIV status.

Olesen TB, Iftner T, Mwaiselage J, Kahesa C, Rasch V, Ngoma T, Munk C, Kjaer SK.

Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen,
Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Infection with high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) is
associated with penile cancer in men, cervical cancer in women, and anal cancer
and certain types of head and neck cancers in both sexes. Few studies have
assessed the prevalence and type distribution of HPV among men in sub-Saharan
Africa, where the rates of HIV and penile and cervical cancer are high.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional study among 1813 men in
Tanzania. Penile samples were tested using Hybrid Capture 2, and genotyping was
done by the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra test. Blood samples were tested for
HIV. The overall and type-specific prevalence and 95% confidence interval of HPV 
was estimated in relation to age and HIV status.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HPV was 20.5% (95% confidence interval,
18.7-22.4), the most prevalent HR HPV types being HPV52, HPV51, HPV16, HPV18,
HPV35, and HPV66. The HR HPV prevalence was significantly higher in HIV-positive 
men (25.7%) than in HIV-negative men (15.8%; P = 0.0027). The prevalence of
HPV16, HPV18 and multiple HR HPVs tended to be higher among HIV-positive men
(statistically nonsignificant), whereas no differences were observed for the
other HPV types.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of HPV types 52, 51, 16, 18, 35, and 66. 
This information is of relevance in the understanding of HPV type distributions
across populations. Although the prevalence of HPV16 and HPV18 was slightly
higher among HIV-positive men, our results indicate that HIV status does not
strongly influence the distribution of HPV types. Therefore, the currently
available HPV vaccines could prevent HPV infection independently of HIV status.

Low prevalence of bilateral (presumed nutritional) optic neuropathy as a cause of
blindness in the Gambia.

Dalmar AA, Hodson KE, Plant GT.

National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVE: Previous reports of epidemics of optic neuropathy in Africa have
mainly focused on eastern and central areas. Our study aimed to measure the
prevalence of optic neuropathy in The Gambia, a West African country, and compare
this prevalence with a simultaneously occurring epidemic of optic neuropathy, now
considered endemic, in Tanzania.
METHODS: The sample population, derived from the Gambian National Blindness
Survey (1996), was selected using simple random sampling. Thirty-three cases of
low vision/blindness were identified where optic neuropathy was the sole cause of
visual loss. Within a month, 31 cases were located and these patients underwent
ophthalmic and peripheral nerve assessment and completed lifestyle
questionnaires.
RESULTS: Five of the 31 individuals were found to have bilateral symmetrical
optic neuropathy. Although it was not possible to fully ascertain etiology, the
phenotype is compatible with epidemic, presumed nutritional, optic neuropathy
described in Tanzania. Comparative prevalence data suggest a prevalence of 0.07% 
in The Gambia based on a total sample size of 6873 vs 2.4% in Tanzania.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that bilateral optic neuropathy is nonepidemic in
The Gambia. Rare vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies reported in rural Gambians
may explain the low prevalence because previous epidemics were due to nutrient
deficiency. Our study is the only available estimate of epidemic optic neuropathy
in The Gambia and, as such, provides an important contribution to our knowledge
in identifying characteristics that may cause specific populations to be more
susceptible to this public health burden.

Effectiveness of health sector reforms in reducing disparities in utilization of 
skilled birth attendants in Tanzania.

Kengia JT, Igarashi I, Kawabuchi K.

Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. jtkengia.hce@tmd.ac.jp

Improving maternal health is a Millennium Development Goal adopted at the 2000
Millennium Summit of the United Nations. As part of the improving maternal health
in Tanzania, it has been recommended that skilled birth attendants be present at 
all births to help reduce the high maternal mortality ratio. However, utilization
of these attendants varies across socio-economic groups. The government of
Tanzania has repeatedly attempted to carry out health sector reforms (HSRs) to
alleviate disparities in health service utilization. In particular, around 1999, 
HSRs were incorporated into two approaches, including Decentralization by
Devolution and Sector Wide Approach. This study aims to clarify the unresolved
questions with little published evidence on the effect of HSRs on reducing
disparities in utilization of skilled birth attendants across socio-economic
groups over time. We used four cross-sectional datasets from the Tanzania
Demographic and Health Survey: 1992, 1996, 1999, and 2004/05. Subjects included
14,752 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and data on the most recent birth 
in the 5 years before each survey. Logistic regression analysis was performed
with the dependent variable of whether respondents utilized skilled birth
attendants or not, and with the main independent variables of time and
socio-economic group. Results showed that the disparity in utilization of skilled
birth attendants was significantly decreased from 1999 to 2004/05. These findings
suggest that the two strategies, Decentralization by Devolution and Sector Wide
Approach, in the process of HSRs are effective in reducing the disparities in
utilization of skilled birth attendants among socio-economic groups.

Nephrology in Africa-not yet uhuru.

Swanepoel CR, Wearne N, Okpechi IG.

Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine, Groote Schuur
Hospital and University of Cape Town, Observatory 7925, Cape Town, South Africa.

Nephrology is a 'Cinderella speciality', a disregarded area of health care, in
Africa. Other health issues have relegated the treatment of kidney diseases to a 
low priority status, and the cost of treating the more common and widespread
communicable diseases, financial mismanagement and corruption in many countries
has sounded the death knell for expensive therapies such as dialysis. The
communicable diseases that have devastated the health systems around Africa are
tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Until recently, very little information was available 
on the impact of HIV on acute and chronic dialysis admissions. Patients with
acute kidney injury (AKI) in most of Africa are seldom treated because of great
distances to travel, lack of expertise, poverty and poor sustainable funding for 
health matters. An acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) programme has now been
initiated in Tanzania but the sustainability of this project will be tested in
the future. The International Society of Nephrology (ISN) has developed a
training programme for nephrologists from developing countries, which may now be 
bearing fruit. A report from the sub-Saharan Africa region shows that the numbers
of patients on dialysis and those diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has
increased significantly. Other ISN-sponsored programmes such as Continuing
Medical Education activities for physicians and community screening projects have
had far-reaching positive effects. Government funding for a dialysis programme is
well established in South Africa, but this funding is limited so that the numbers
accepted for public dialysis are restricted. Consequently in the Western Cape
province of South Africa, a 'category system' has been formulated to attempt to
cope with this unacceptable and restrictive ruling.

Challenges to the implementation of International Health Regulations (2005) on
preventing infectious diseases: experience from Julius Nyerere International
Airport, Tanzania.

Bakari E, Frumence G.

Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: The International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) is a legal
instrument binding all World Health Organization (WHO) member States. It aims to 
prevent and control public health emergencies of international concern. Country
points of entry (POEs) have been identified as potential areas for effective
interventions to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases across borders. 
The agreement postulates that member states will strengthen core capacities
detailed in the IHR (2005), including those specified for the POE. This study
intended to assess the challenges faced in implementing the IHR (2005)
requirements at Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA), Dar es Salaam.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive study, employing qualitative methods, was 
conducted at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW), WHO, and JNIA.
In-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) and documentary reviews were 
used to obtain relevant information. Respondents were purposively enrolled into
the study. Thematic analysis was used to generate study findings.
RESULTS: Several challenges that hamper implementation of the IHR (2005) were
identified: (1) none of the 42 Tanzanian POEs have been specifically designated
to implement IHR (2005). (2) Implementation of the IHR (2005) at the POE was
complicated as it falls under various uncoordinated government departments.
Although there were clear communication channels at JNIA that enhanced reliable
risk communication, the airport lacked isolated rooms specific for emergence
preparedness and response to public health events.
CONCLUSIONS: JNIA is yet to develop adequate core capacities required for
implementation of the IHR (2005). There is a need for policy managers to
designate JNIA to implement IHR (2005) and ensure that public health policies,
legislations, guidelines, and practice at POE are harmonized to improve
international travel and trade. Policy makers and implementers should also ensure
that implementation of the IHR (2005) follow the policy implementation framework,
particularly the contextual interaction theory which calls for the availability
of adequate resources (inputs) and well-organized process for the successful
implementation of the policy.

Traumatic Brain Injury in a Rural and an Urban Tanzanian Hospital-A Comparative, 
Retrospective Analysis Based on Computed Tomography.

Maier D, Njoku I Jr, Schmutzhard E, Dharsee J, Doppler M, Härtl R, Winkler AS.

Department of Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.

BACKGROUND: In a resource-poor environment such as rural East Africa, expensive
medical devices such as computed tomographic (CT) scanners are rare. The CT
scanner at the rural Haydom Lutheran Hospital (HLH) in Tanzania therefore offers 
a unique chance to observe possible differences with urban medical centers in the
disease pattern of trauma-related cranial pathologies. The purpose of this study 
was to compare traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) between a rural and an urban area 
of Tanzania.
METHODS: HLH has 350 beds and one CT scanner. The urban Aga Khan Hospital is a
private hospital with 80 beds and one CT scanner. This was a retrospective study.
Data of 248 patients at HLH and of 432 patients at Aga Khan Hospital with TBI
could be collected.
RESULTS: The prevalence of TBI was significantly higher in the rural area
compared to the urban area (34.2% vs. 21.9%, P < 0.0001). TBI due to violence was
noted to occur more frequently at HLH, whereas road traffic accidents were more
frequent at the Aga Khan Hospital. The number of patients showing a normal CT
result was significantly higher in the urban area (53.0% vs. 35.9%, P < 0.0001). 
Bone fractures (35.9% vs. 15.7%, P < 0.0001) and pneumocephalus (6.9% vs. 0.9%, P
< 0.0001) were diagnosed significantly more frequently in the rural survey. Soft 
tissue swelling (11.6% vs. 1.2%, P < 0.0001) and frontal sinus injuries (7.4% vs.
0.4%, P < 0.0001) were observed significantly more often in the urban setting.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the burden of TBI and the differences in
TBI-related CT diagnoses and their incidence between urban and rural areas in
Eastern Africa. These results are important as they demonstrate that patients
with severe TBI are not a primarily urban concern. Management of TBI should be
included in the training curricula for health personnel alike irrespective of
whether their workplace is primarily urban or rural.

Inter-epidemic transmission of Rift Valley fever in livestock in the Kilombero
River Valley, Tanzania: a cross-sectional survey.

Ifakara Health Institute, Ifakara, Tanzania. rsumaye@ihi.or.tz

BACKGROUND: In recent years, evidence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission
during inter-epidemic periods in parts of Africa has increasingly been reported. 
The inter-epidemic transmissions generally pass undetected where there is no
surveillance in the livestock or human populations. We studied the presence of
and the determinants for inter-epidemic RVF transmission in an area experiencing 
annual flooding in southern Tanzania.
METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in randomly selected
cattle, sheep and goats in the Kilombero river valley from May to August 2011,
approximately four years after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Tanzania. The exposure
status to RVF virus (RVFV) was determined using two commercial ELISA kits,
detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in serum. Information about determinants was
obtained through structured interviews with herd owners.
FINDINGS: An overall seroprevalence of 11.3% (n = 1680) was recorded; 5.5% in
animals born after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak and 22.7% in animals present during
the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in the post-epidemic
annual cohorts. Nine inhibition-ELISA positive samples were also positive for
RVFV IgM antibodies indicating a recent infection. The spatial distribution of
seroprevalence exhibited a few hotspots. The sex difference in seroprevalence in 
animals born after the previous epidemic was not significant (6.1% vs. 4.6% for
females and males respectively, p = 0.158) whereas it was significant in animals 
present during the outbreak (26.0% vs. 7.8% for females and males respectively,
p<0.001). Animals living >15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have
antibodies than those living <5 km (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.04-3.56). Species, breed,
herd composition, grazing practices and altitude were not associated with
seropositivity.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate post-epidemic transmission of RVFV in the
study area. The linear increase in seroprevalence in the post-epidemic annual
cohorts implies a constant exposure and presence of active foci transmission
preceding the survey.

Risk factors for high-risk human papillomavirus detection among HIV-negative and 
HIV-positive women from Tanzania.

Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually
transmitted infections worldwide. The prevalence is dependent on several known
factors notably sexual behavior and age, and factors still under scrutiny.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine risk factors for high-risk (HR) HPV
infection among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women from the general population
of Tanzania and to assess whether specific risk factors could contribute to the
high prevalence of HR HPV infection in older age found in some populations
including Tanzanian women.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 3699 women from Tanzania was conducted. We
obtained information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors through personal
interview. Cervical swabs were collected for detection of HR HPV (Hybrid Capture 
2; Qiagen, Hildesheim, Germany) and genotyping (LiPaExtra; Innogenetics, Gent,
Belgium). Finally, we obtained a blood sample for HIV testing.
RESULTS: HIV positivity was the strongest risk factor for HR HPV (odds ratio,
4.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.3-5.3). Young age, shorter duration of present
relationship, and increasing number of sex partners were also associated with
higher risk for HR HPV. Among women 20 to 29 years old, especially number of
partners (P = 0.005) and HIV positivity (P < 0.0001) determined the risk. In
underweight women 50 years or older (P = 0.004) and HIV positivity (P = 0.0009)
increased the risk, whereas increasing number of partners was not related to the 
risk of HR HPV (P = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus risk factors among HIV-positive and
HIV-negative women were similar, but the strength of association was greater
among HIV-positive women, notably for lifetime number of sex partners, time in
present relationship, genital warts, and body mass index. We were not able to
identify a clear explanation for the high HPV prevalence among older women.
However, in the age-stratified analysis, potential indicators of decreased
immunity increased the risk for HPV infection among older women, whereas in
younger women, risk was particularly associated with sexual activity.

PurposeThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative
intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) for improving outcomes in vitrectomy for diabetic 
retinopathy-related non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage and/or tractional retinal
detachment.MethodsMedical record from patients undergoing vitrectomy for
proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) were retrospectively analysed
(2003-2011). From 2007, IVB (1.25â€‰mg 2-4 days before operating) was used on all
eyes. Eyes receiving IVB were compared with those that did not receive IVB.
Intraoperative complications, reoperation rates, and final visual acuity were the
core outcome measures.ResultsData were analysed for 88 patients (101 eyes). In
all, 41 (41%) patients had received IVB, whereas 60 (59%) patients had not.
Significant intraoperative haemorrhage occurred in six eyes (10%) in the non-IVB 
group and in one (2.4%) IVB eyes (P=0.24). Silicon oil was used in 29 (48%)
non-IVB eyes and in 11 (27%) IVB eyes (P=0.03). The non-IVB eyes underwent
significantly more vitreoretinal reoperations (P=0.01) and were significantly
more likely to lose two or more lines of vision at the final follow-up (P=0.03). 
The numbers needed to treat (NNT) blindness (<3/60) was four for non-IVB eyes and
two for the IVB group.ConclusionsIVB reduces surgical complications, the use of
silicon oil, and the need for further retinal surgery. The NNT to restore useful 
vision (â‰¥3/60) to a blind eye were significantly lower in the IVB group.
Vitreoretinal surgery for the complications of PDR is effective in an East
African context, and IVB should be considered a valuable adjunct.Eye advance

INTRODUCTION: Anaemia is prevalent among children born to HIV-positive women, and
it is associated with adverse effects on cognitive and motor development, growth,
and increased risks of morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of daily multivitamin supplementation on
haematologic status and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV through
breastfeeding.
METHODS: A total of 2387 infants born to HIV-positive women from Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,
and provided a daily oral supplement of multivitamins (vitamin B complex, C and
E) or placebo at age 6 weeks for 24 months. Among them, 2008 infants provided
blood samples and had haemoglobin concentrations measured at baseline and during 
a follow-up period. Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin concentrations <11 g/dL
and severe anaemia <8.5 g/dL.
RESULTS: Haemoglobin concentrations among children in the treatment group were
significantly higher than those in the placebo group at 12 (9.77 vs. 9.64 g/dL,
p=0.03), 18 (9.76 vs. 9.57 g/dL, p=0.004), and 24 months (9.93 vs. 9.75 g/dL,
p=0.02) of follow-up. Compared to those in the placebo group, children in the
treatment group had a 12% lower risk of anaemia (hazard ratio (HR): 0.88; 95% CI:
0.79-0.99; p=0.03). The treatment was associated with a 28% reduced risk of
severe anaemia among children born to women without anaemia (HR: 0.72; 95% CI:
0.56-0.92; p=0.008), but not among those born to women with anaemia (HR: 1.10;
95% CI: 0.79-1.54; p=0.57; p for interaction=0.007). One thousand seven hundred
fifty three infants who tested HIV-negative at baseline and had HIV testing
during follow-up were included in the analysis for MTCT of HIV. No association
was found between multivitamin supplements and MTCT of HIV.
CONCLUSIONS: Multivitamin supplements improve haematologic status among children 
born to HIV-positive women. Further trials focusing on anaemia among HIV-exposed 
children are warranted in the context of antiretroviral therapy.

The changing cultural and economic dynamics of polygyny and concurrent sexual
partnerships in Iringa, Tanzania.

Polygyny has been identified both as a 'benign' form of concurrency and as the
cultural basis of concurrent partnerships that are considered important drivers
of the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper investigates the changing
cultural and economic dynamics of polygyny in concurrency in Iringa, Tanzania, a 
region with traditions of polygyny and high prevalence of HIV. Our analysis of
focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews
indicate that contemporary concurrent partnerships differ from regional
traditions of polygyny. Whereas in the past, polygyny reflected men's and their
kin group's wealth and garnered additional prestige, polygyny today is
increasingly seen as a threat to health, and as leading to poverty. Nevertheless,
participants evoked the social prestige of polygyny to explain men's present-day 
concurrency, even outside the bounds of marriage, and despite continued social
prohibitions against extramarital affairs. Difficult economic conditions,
combined with this prestige, made it easier for men to engage in concurrency
without the considerable obligations to wives and children in polygyny. Local
economic conditions also compelled women to seek concurrent partners to meet
basic needs and to access consumer goods, but risked greater moral judgement than
men, especially if deemed to have excessive 'desire' for money.

The study estimated the prevalence of HIV-1 intra-subtype recombinant variants
among female bar and hotel workers in Tanzania. While intra-subtype recombination
occurs in HIV-1, it is generally underestimated. HIV-1 env gp120 V1-C5
quasispecies from 45 subjects were generated by single-genome amplification and
sequencing (median (IQR) of 38 (28-50) sequences per subject). Recombination
analysis was performed using seven methods implemented within the recombination
detection program version 3, RDP3. HIV-1 sequences were considered recombinant if
recombination signals were detected by at least three methods with p-values of
â‰¤0.05 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. HIV-1 in 38 (84%)
subjects showed evidence for intra-subtype recombination including 22 with HIV-1 
subtype A1, 13 with HIV-1 subtype C, and 3 with HIV-1 subtype D. The distribution
of intra-patient recombination breakpoints suggested ongoing recombination and
showed selective enrichment of recombinant variants in 23 (60%) subjects. The
number of subjects with evidence of intra-subtype recombination increased from 29
(69%) to 36 (82%) over one year of follow-up, although the increase did not reach
statistical significance. Adjustment for intra-subtype recombination is important
for the analysis of multiplicity of HIV infection. This is the first report of
high prevalence of intra-subtype recombination in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in
Tanzania, a region where multiple HIV-1 subtypes co-circulate. HIV-1
intra-subtype recombination increases viral diversity and presents additional
challenges for HIV-1 vaccine design.

We examined the impacts of nationwide voluntary medical male circumcision efforts
in Tanzania. Using Demographic and Health Surveys data, we found that
circumcision rates increased from 37% to 47% in regions targeted by the program. 
Those who took up medical male circumcision were younger, more educated,
wealthier, and more likely to use condoms. Efforts going forward should focus on 
stimulating circumcision demand among more vulnerable men.

Getting antimalarials on target: impact of national roll-out of malaria rapid
diagnostic tests on health facility treatment in three regions of Tanzania.

Institute, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

OBJECTIVES: Parasitological confirmation of malaria prior to treatment is
recommended for patients of all ages, with malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs)
an important tool to target artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to
patients with malaria. To evaluate the impact on case management practices of
routine government implementation of mRDTs, we conducted large-scale health
facility surveys in three regions of Tanzania before and after mRDT roll-out.
METHODS: Febrile patients at randomly selected health facilities were interviewed
about care received at the facility, and blood samples were collected for
reference blood smears. Health facility staff were interviewed about their
qualifications and availability of malaria diagnostics and drugs.
RESULTS: The percentage of febrile patients tested for malaria at the facility
increased from 15.8% in 2010 to 54.9% in 2012. ACTs were obtained by 65.8% of
patients positive by reference blood smear in 2010 and by 50.2% in 2012
(PÂ =Â 0.0675); no antimalarial was obtained by 57.8% of malaria-negative patients 
in 2010 and by 82.3% in 2012 (PÂ <Â 0.0001). Overall, ACT use decreased
(39.9-21.3%, PÂ <Â 0.0001) and antibiotic use increased (31.2-48.5%, PÂ <Â 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Roll-out of mRDTs in Tanzania dramatically improved diagnostic
testing for malaria and reduced overuse of ACTs for patients without parasitemia.
However, post-roll-out almost 50% of febrile patients did not receive a
diagnostic test, and almost 50% of patients testing positive did not receive
ACTs. Stock-outs of ACTs and mRDTs were important problems. Further investigation
is needed to determine reasons for not providing ACTs to patients with malaria
and potential for inappropriate antibiotic use.

We explored response to single-dose praziquantel therapy in a cohort of 33 women 
with Schistosoma haematobium infection in rural Mwanza, Tanzania. Women with
S.Â haematobium infection confirmed both by eggs in urine and by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) received single-dose praziquantel and treatment of concomitant
sexually transmitted infections. Macroscopic cervical abnormalities were also
quantified. After 6Â months, microscopically detectable egg excretion was
eliminated, but 8 of 33 women (24%) were persistently positive for S.Â haematobium
by PCR, and 11 (33%) had cervical abnormalities potentially attributable to
schistosomiasis. This suggests that praziquantel treatment more frequently than
every 6Â months may be necessary for complete elimination of the parasite and
prevention of genital tissue pathology. This aggressive therapy may in turn play 
a key role decreasing HIV susceptibility in millions of people living in regions 
in which S.Â haematobium is endemic.

Cryptococcal antigen prevalence in HIV-infected Tanzanians: a cross-sectional
study and evaluation of a point-of-care lateral flow assay.

Department of Medicine, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College, Moshi, 
Tanzania.

OBJECTIVES: Cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) screening at antiretroviral therapy (ART)
initiation and pre-emptive antifungal treatment for those testing positive could 
prevent many cases of cryptococcal meningitis (CM). To investigate whether CRAG
screening would be feasible in Tanzania, we conducted a cross-sectional study
measuring CRAG prevalence in ART clinic patients and comparing the novel lateral 
flow assay (LFA) with the cryptococcal latex agglutination (LA) test.
METHODS: Consecutive HIV-infected outpatients with CD4 counts <200 cells/ÂµL, who 
were ART naive or had been on ART for <6Â months, were screened for CRAG using the
LA and LFA kits. For further assay validation, HIV-infected inpatients with
suspected cryptococcal disease were also tested using the LA and LFA kits.
RESULTS: Cryptococcal antigen was detected in seven of 218 ART clinic attendees
(3%). Six patients (5%) with CD4 cell counts â‰¤100Â cells/ÂµL (nÂ =Â 124) were
CRAG-positive. Agreement between the LA and LFA test in the 218 outpatients was
100%. Another 101 inpatients were tested for CRAG, of whom 56 (55%) were
CRAG-positive on both the LA and LFA tests. One patient was positive using the
LFA test but negative on the LA test. The overall agreement between the two
assays was 99.7%, kappa coefficient 0.99 (standard error 0.06, PÂ <Â 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Five percentage of ART clinic patients with CD4 cell counts
â‰¤100Â cells/ÂµL in northern Tanzania had asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenaemia,
suggesting that CRAG screening would be worthwhile in the Tanzanian ART
programme. The LFA is a reliable, cheap and practical alternative to LA for
detection of CRAG.

BACKGROUND: Soil-transmitted helminths and intestinal protozoa infection are
widespread in developing countries, yet an accurate diagnosis is rarely
performed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recently developed
mini-FLOTAC method and to compare with currently more widely used techniques for 
the diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections in different settings.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study was carried out in Dharamsala, Himachal
Pradesh, India, and in Bukumbi, Tanzania. A total of 180 pupils from two primary 
schools had their stool analyzed (n = 80 in Dharamsala and n = 100 in Bukumbi)
for intestinal parasitic infections with three diagnostic methods: direct fecal
smear, formol-ether concentration method (FECM) and mini-FLOTAC. Overall, 72% of 
the pupils were positive for any intestinal parasitic infection, 24% carried dual
infections and 11% three infections or more. The most frequently encountered
intestinal parasites were Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Giardia
intestinalis, hookworm, (and Schistosoma mansoni, in Tanzania). Statistically
significant differences were found in the detection of parasitic infections among
the three methods: mini-FLOTAC was the most sensitive method for helminth
infections (90% mini-FLOTAC, 60% FECM, and 30% direct fecal smear), whereas FECM 
was most sensitive for intestinal protozoa infections (88% FECM, 70% direct fecal
smear, and 68% mini-FLOTAC).
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We present the first experiences with the mini-FLOTAC
for the diagnosis of intestinal helminths and protozoa. Our results suggest that 
it is a valid, sensitive and potentially low-cost alternative technique that
could be used in resource-limited settings--particularly for helminth diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Trachoma, caused by ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection, is the
leading infectious cause of blindness, but its prevalence is now falling in many 
countries. As the prevalence falls, an increasing proportion of individuals with 
clinical signs of follicular trachoma (TF) is not infected with C. trachomatis. A
recent study in Tanzania suggested that other bacteria may play a role in the
persistence of these clinical signs.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined associations between clinical signs
of TF and ocular colonization with four pathogens commonly found in the
nasopharnyx, three years after the initiation of mass azithromycin distribution. 
Children aged 0 to 5 years were randomly selected from 16 Gambian communities.
Both eyes of each child were examined and graded for trachoma according to the
World Health Organization (WHO) simplified system. Two swabs were taken from the 
right eye: one swab was processed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the
Amplicor test for detection of C. trachomatis DNA and the second swab was
processed by routine bacteriology to assay for the presence of viable
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and
Moraxella catarrhalis. Prevalence of TF was 6.2% (96/1538) while prevalence of
ocular C. trachomatis infection was 1.0% (16/1538). After adjustment, increased
odds of TF were observed in the presence of C. trachomatis (OR = 10.4, 95%CI
1.32-81.2, p = 0.03), S. pneumoniae (OR = 2.14, 95%CI 1.03-4.44, p = 0.04) and H.
influenzae (OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.53-14.5, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Clinical signs of TF can persist in communities even
when ocular C. trachomatis infection has been controlled through mass
azithromycin distribution. In these settings, TF may be associated with ocular
colonization with bacteria commonly carried in the nasopharnyx. This may affect
the interpretation of impact surveys and the determinations of thresholds for
discontinuing mass drug administration.

and forest resources.

In many developing countries, political documentation acknowledges the crucial
elements of participation and spatiality for effective land use planning.
However, operative approaches to spatial data inclusion and representation in
participatory land management are often lacking. In this paper, we apply and
develop an integrated landscape characterization approach to enhance spatial
knowledge generation about the complex human-nature interactions in landscapes in
the context of Zanzibar, Tanzania. We apply an integrated landscape
conceptualization as a theoretical framework where the expert and local knowledge
can meet in spatial context. The characterization is based on combining multiple 
data sources in GIS, and involves local communities and their local spatial
knowledge since the beginning into the process. Focusing on the expected
information needs for community forest management, our characterization
integrates physical landscape features and retrospective landscape change data
with place-specific community knowledge collected through participatory GIS
techniques. The characterization is established in a map form consisting of four 
themes and their synthesis. The characterization maps are designed to support
intuitive interpretation, express the inherently uncertain nature of the data,
and accompanied by photographs to enhance communication. Visual interpretation of
the characterization mediates information about the character of areas and places
in the studied local landscape, depicting the role of forest resources as part of
the landscape entity. We conclude that landscape characterization applied in GIS 
is a highly potential tool for participatory land and resource management, where 
spatial argumentation, stakeholder communication, and empowerment are critical
issues.

Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4AZ. katherine.wilson@ncl.ac.uk

AIM: A pilot questionnaire survey was carried out to determine levels of patient 
satisfaction with oral urgent treatment (OUT) provided by rural clinical officers
who had been trained by the charity Bridge2Aid in North West Tanzania.
METHOD: The survey was carried out over a five-day period, among adult patients
who had received oral urgent treatment from a trained clinical officer. A
satisfaction questionnaire was administered by a team of English-speaking dental 
students and Swahili-speaking college students under supervision.
RESULTS: A total of 140 questionnaires were completed. The overall satisfaction
with the OUT service provided by the clinical officers was high, with 93.6% being
very satisfied or satisfied. However, some areas were highlighted where
improvements could be made: providing a clearer explanation of treatment,
improved pain control and reducing costs of treatment.

Exploring the potential of a conditional cash transfer intervention to reduce HIV
risk among young women in Iringa, Tanzania.

Cash transfer programs seek to alter structural determinants of HIV risk such as 
poverty and gender inequality. We sought to explore the feasibility and potential
effectiveness of a cash transfer intervention for young women as part of
combination HIV prevention in Iringa, Tanzania. Qualitative, in-depth interviews 
were conducted with 116 stakeholders and residents from the region, including key
informants, service delivery users, and members of key populations. Most
respondents felt a cash transfer program would assist young women in Iringa to
have more control over sexual decision-making and reduce poverty-driven
transactional sex. Respondents were divided on who should receive funds: young
women themselves, their parents/guardians, or community leaders. Cash amounts and
suggested target groups varied, and several respondents suggested providing
microcredit or small business capital instead of cash. Potential concerns
included jealousy, dependency, and corruption. However, most respondents felt
that some intervention was needed to address underlying poverty driving some
sexual risk behavior. A cash transfer program could fill this role, ultimately
reducing HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies. As
increased attention is given to economic and structural interventions for HIV
prevention, local input and knowledge should be considered in a program design.

The evolutionary ecology of early weaning in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania.

Wander K, Mattison SM.

kwander@uw.edu

Public health recommendations promote prolonged breastfeeding of all children;
however, parental investment (PI) theory predicts that breastfeeding will be
allocated among a mothers' offspring to maximize her reproductive success. We
evaluated PI in terms of risk for weaning before age two among 283 children in
Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Results demonstrate: (i) a Trivers-Willard effect--high
socioeconomic status (SES) females and low SES males were more likely to be
weaned early; (ii) later-born children were less likely to be weaned early; (iii)
higher birthweight children were less likely to be weaned early, and (iv) no
effect of cattle (a source of supplementary milk) ownership. These associations
were largely independent and remained significant in models controlling for
potential confounders; however, the inverse association between early weaning and
birth order lost significance in the model containing birthweight. These patterns
were observed despite public health recommendations encouraging breastfeeding for
at least two years.

Feasibility of introducing compulsory community health fund in low resource
countries: views from the communities in Liwale district of Tanzania.

Marwa B, Njau B, Kessy J, Mushi D.

BACKGROUND: In 1995, Tanzania introduced the voluntary Community Health Fund
(CHF) with the aim of ensuring universal health coverage by increasing financial 
investment in the health sector. The uptake of the CHF is low, with an enrolment 
of only 6% compared to the national target of 75%. Mandatory models of community 
health financing have been suggested to increase enrolment and financial
capacity. This study explores communities' views on the introduction of a
mandatory model, the Compulsory Community Health Fund (CCHF) in the Liwale
district of Tanzania.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study which involved 387 participants in a structured 
face to face survey and 33 in qualitative interviews (26 in focus group
discussions (FGD) and 7 in in-depth interviews (IDI). Structured survey data were
analyzed using SPSS version 16 to produce descriptive statistics. Qualitative
data were analyzed using content analysis.
RESULTS: 387 people completed a survey (58% males), mean age 38 years. Most
participants (347, 89.7%) were poor subsistence farmers and 229 (59.2%) had never
subscribed to any form of health insurance scheme. The idea of a CCHF was
accepted by 221 (57%) survey participants. Reasons for accepting the CCHF
included: reduced out of pocket expenditure, improved quality of health care and 
the removal of stigma for those who receive waivers at health care delivery
points. The major reason for not accepting the CCHF was the poor quality of
health care services currently offered. Participants suggested that enrolment to 
the CCHF be done after harvesting when the population were more likely to have
disposable income, and that the quality care of care and benefits package be
improved.
CONCLUSIONS: The CHF is acceptable to the most of study participants and feasible
in rural Tanzania as an alternative mechanism to finance health care for the
rural poor. Community members are willing to join the scheme provided they are
well informed, involved in the design and implementation, and assured quality
health care. Strong political will and a supportive environment are key
ingredients for the success of the CCHF.

The impact of education and globalization on sexual and reproductive health:
Retrospective evidence from eastern and southern Africa.

Van Stam MA, Michielsen K, Stroeken K, Zijlstra BJ.

a Department of Child Development and Education , University of Amsterdam ,
Amsterdam , The Netherlands.

The objective of this study is to qualify the relationship between sexual and
reproductive health (SRH) and educational attainment in eastern and southern
Africa (ESA). We hypothesize that the regional level of globalization is a
moderating factor in the relationship between SRH and educational attainment.
Using retrospective data from Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia, the
associations between SRH (eight indicators), educational attainment, and
globalization were examined using multilevel logistic regression analysis. It was
found that the model fit for every SRH outcome indicator increased significantly 
after including the interaction between globalization and educational attainment,
supporting the hypothesis. Depending on the level of globalization, three types
of relationships between education and SRH were found: (1) for the indicators
"more than four children," "intercourse before 17 years," "first child before 20 
years," and "one or more child died" education is risk-decreasing, and the
reduction is stronger in more globalized regions; (2) for the indicators "condom 
use at last intercourse" and "current contraceptive use" education is
risk-decreasing, and the reduction is stronger in less globalized regions; (3)
for the indicators "HIV positive" and "more than four lifetime sexual partners"
education is risk increasing, but only in less globalized regions. In conclusion,
these effects are related to three types of access: (1) access to services, (2)
access to information, and (3) access to sexual networks. The findings highlight 
the relevance of globalization when analyzing the association between SRH and
education, and the importance of structural factors in the development of
effective SRH promotion interventions.

Do price subsidies on artemisinin combination therapy for malaria increase
household use? Evidence from a repeated cross-sectional study in remote regions
of Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: The Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm) is a pilot program
that uses price subsidies to increase access to Artemisinin Combination Therapies
(ACTs), currently the most effective malaria treatment. Recent evidence suggests 
that availability and affordability of ACTs in retail sector drug shops (where
many people treat malaria) has increased under the AMFm, but it is unclear
whether household level ACT use has increased.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: household surveys were conducted in two remote regions of
Tanzania (Mtwara and Rukwa) in three waves: March 2011, December 2011 and March
2012, corresponding to 3, 13 and 16 months into the AMFm implementation
respectively. Information about suspected malaria episodes including treatment
location and medications taken was collected. Respondents were also asked about
antimalarial preferences and perceptions about the availability of these
medications. Significant increases in ACT use, preference and perceived
availability were found between Rounds 1 and 3 though not for all measures
between Rounds 1 and 2. ACT use among suspected malaria episodes was 51.1% in
March 2011 and increased by 10.9 percentage points by Round 3 (pâ€Š=â€Š.017). The
greatest increase was among retail sector patients, where ACT use increased from 
31% in Round 1 to 49% in Round 2 (pâ€Š=â€Š.037) and to 61% (p<.0001) by Round 3. The 
fraction of suspected malaria episodes treated in the retail sector increased
from 30.2% in Round 1 to 46.7% in Round 3 (pâ€Š=â€Š.0009), mostly due to a decrease
in patients who sought no treatment at all. No significant changes in public
sector treatment seeking were found.
CONCLUSIONS: The AMFm has led to significant increases in ACT use for suspected
malaria, especially in the retail sector. No evidence is found supporting the
concerns that the AMFm would crowd out public sector treatment or neglect
patients in remote areas and from low SES groups.

The potential impact of improving appropriate treatment for fever on malaria and 
non-malarial febrile illness management in under-5s: a decision-tree modelling
approach.

Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: As international funding for malaria programmes plateaus, limited
resources must be rationally managed for malaria and non-malarial febrile
illnesses (NMFI). Given widespread unnecessary treatment of NMFI with first-line 
antimalarial Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs), our aim was to estimate
the effect of health-systems factors on rates of appropriate treatment for fever 
and on use of ACTs.
METHODS: A decision-tree tool was developed to investigate the impact of
improving aspects of the fever care-pathway and also evaluate the impact in
Tanzania of the revised WHO malaria guidelines advocating diagnostic-led
management.
RESULTS: Model outputs using baseline parameters suggest 49% malaria cases
attending a clinic would receive ACTs (95% Uncertainty Interval:40.6-59.2%) but
that 44% (95% UI:35-54.8%) NMFI cases would also receive ACTs. Provision of 100% 
ACT stock predicted a 28.9% increase in malaria cases treated with ACT, but also 
an increase in overtreatment of NMFI, with 70% NMFI cases (95% UI:56.4-79.2%)
projected to receive ACTs, and thus an overall 13% reduction (95% UI:5-21.6%) in 
correct management of febrile cases. Modelling increased availability or use of
diagnostics had little effect on malaria management outputs, but may
significantly reduce NMFI overtreatment. The model predicts the early rollout of 
revised WHO guidelines in Tanzania may have led to a 35% decrease (95%
UI:31.2-39.8%) in NMFI overtreatment, but also a 19.5% reduction (95%
UI:11-27.2%), in malaria cases receiving ACTs, due to a potential fourfold
decrease in cases that were untested or tested false-negative (42.5% vs.8.9%) and
so untreated.
DISCUSSION: Modelling multi-pronged intervention strategies proved most effective
to improve malaria treatment without increasing NMFI overtreatment. As malaria
transmission declines, health system interventions must be guided by whether the 
management priority is an increase in malaria cases receiving ACTs (reducing the 
treatment gap), reducing ACT waste through unnecessary treatment of NMFI or
expanding appropriate treatment of all febrile illness.

Here we explore the association between killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 
(KIR)/HLA and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition with
different viral subtypes circulating in East Africa. In the prospective Cohort
Development (CODE) cohort (Mbeya, Tanzania), carriers of KIR3DS1 and its putative
ligand (HLA-A or HLA-B Bw4-80Ile alleles) showed increased HIV-1 acquisition risk
(odds ratio [OR] = 3.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-10.63; P = .04) and a
trend for enrichment for subtype A and A-containing recombinants (78% vs 46%; OR 
= 4.05; 95% CI, .91-28.30; P = .09) at the expense of subtype C (11% vs 43%; OR =
0.17; 95% CI, .01-.97; P = .08). In vitro, only natural killer cells from
KIR3DS1(+)/HLA-Bw4-80Ile(+) healthy donors showed a 2-fold increased capacity to 
inhibit replication of subtype C vs subtype A viruses (P = .01). These findings
suggest the presence of an innate sieve effect and may inform HIV-1 vaccine
development.

The diminished interhemispheric connectivity correlates with negative symptoms
and cognitive impairment in first-episode schizophrenia.

Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Province, Central South University,
Changsha, Hunan 410011, China; College of Health Sciences, University of Dodoma, 
P.O Box 395, Dodoma, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies imply that interhemispheric disconnectivity plays a 
more important role on information processing in schizophrenia. However, the role
of the aberrant interhemispheric connection in the pathophysiology of this
disorder remains unclear. Recently, resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (fMRI) has reported to have potentials of mapping functional interactions
between pairs of brain hemispheres.
METHODS: Resting-state whole-brain functional connectivity analyses were
performed on 41 schizophrenia patients and 33 healthy controls.
RESULTS: The first-episode schizophrenia patients showed significant aberrant
interhemispheric connection in the globus pallidus, medial frontal gyrus and
inferior temporal gyrus. The correlation of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale
scores with odds ratio of the aberrant interhemispheric connections revealed
positive correlation in the pallidum (rho=0.335, p=.003) and medial frontal gyrus
(rho=0.260, p=.025). The connection in the pallidum was also positively
correlated with duration of illness (rho=-0.407, p=.009). Whereas, the aberrant
interhemispheric connection in the inferior temporal gyrus was positively
correlated with scores of Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms
(rho=0.393, p=.012).
CONCLUSION: The present study provides fMRI evidence for the aberrant
interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity within resting-state
networks in first-episode schizophrenia patients. These aberrant interhemispheric
connections, in particular the pallidum, due to its anatomical and functional
connectivities, may be the primary disturbance for cognitive impairment, negative
symptoms and chronicity of schizophrenia.

Abstract Objectives: The aim of this paper was to examine the extent to which
socioeconomic factors, anthropological data and somatic indices influenced the
results of spirometric measurements (FEV1 and FVC) in Tanzanian youth. Materials 
and methods: The population studied were young black Bantu men aged 12.8-24.0
years. Analysis was performed for the whole data set (nâ€‰=â€‰255), as well as
separately for two age groups: under 17.5 years (nâ€‰=â€‰168) and 17.5â€‰+â€‰(nâ€‰=â€‰87). A 
backward stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed for FEV1 and FVC as 
dependent variables on socioeconomic and anthropometric data. Results: Multiple
regression analysis for the whole group revealed that the socioeconomic and
anthropometric data under analysis accounted for 38% of the variation in FEV1. In
addition the analysis demonstrated that 34% of the variation in FVC could be
accounted for by the variables used in the regression. A significant impact in
explaining the variability of FVC was exhibited by the thorax mobility, financial
situation of the participants and Pignet-Verwaecka Index. Conclusion: Analysis of
the data indicates the significant role of selected socio-economic factors on the
development of the biological specimens investigated. There were no perceptible
pathologies, and the results can be treated as a credible interpretation of the
influence exerted by the environment in which the teenagers under study grew up.

Sero-prevalence and factors associated with Toxoplasma gondii infection among
pregnant women attending antenatal care in Mwanza, Tanzania.

GroÃŸ U.

Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Catholic University of Health
and Allied Sciences, Mwanza, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Serological screening of pregnant women for Toxoplasma
gondii-specific antibodies is not practiced as an antenatal care in Tanzania; and
there is a limited data about sero-prevalence of T. gondii infection in
developing countries. We therefore conducted this study to determine the
sero-prevalence and factors associated with T. gondii infection among pregnant
women attending antenatal care clinics in Mwanza, Tanzania.
METHODS: Between 1st November 2012 and 31st May 2013 a total of 350 pregnant
women attending antenatal care clinics in Mwanza were enrolled and screened for
IgG and IgM antibodies against T. gondii using the ELISA technique.
RESULTS: Of 350 pregnant women, 108 (30.9%) were sero-positive for T.
gondii-specific antibodies. The risk of contracting T. gondii infection increases
by 7% with each yearly increase in a woman's age (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.11,
p=0.002). The sero-positivity rate of T. gondii-specific antibodies was higher
among pregnant women from the urban than those from rural communities (41.5%
versus 22.0%); [OR=2.2, 95% CI; 1.4 - 3.7, p=0.001]. Likewise employed/business
women were more likely to get T. gondii infection than peasants (40.0% versus
25.9%) [OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.2 - 3.0, p=0.006].
CONCLUSIONS: Sero-prevalence of T. gondii-specific antibodies is high among
pregnant women in Mwanza with a significant proportion of women at risk of
contracting primary T. gondii infections. Screening of T. gondii infections
during antenatal care should be considered in Tanzania as the main strategy to
minimize congenital toxoplasmosis.

Declining HIV-1 prevalence and incidence among Police Officers -- a potential
cohort for HIV vaccine trials, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Munseri PJ, Bakari M, Janabi M, Aris E, Aboud S, Hejdeman B, Sandstrom E.

BACKGROUND: A safe effective and affordable HIV vaccine is the most cost
effective way to prevent HIV infection worldwide. Current studies of HIV
prevalence and incidence are needed to determine potentially suitable cohorts for
vaccine studies. The prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 infection among the police
in Dar es Salaam in 1996 were 13.8% and 19.6/1000 PYAR respectively. This study
aimed at determining the current prevalence and incidence of HIV in a police
cohort 10 years after a similar study was conducted.
METHODS: Police officers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania were prospectively enrolled
into the study from 2005 and followed-up in an incidence study three years later.
HIV infection was determined by two sequential enzyme linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISAs) in the prevalence study and discordant results between two ELISAs were
resolved by a Western blot assay. Rapid HIV assays (SD Bioline and Determine)
were used for the incidence study.
RESULTS: A total of 1,240 police participated in the HIV prevalence study from
August 2005 to November 2008. Of these, 1101 joined the study from August
2005-September 2007 and an additional 139 were recruited between October 2007 to 
November 2008 while conducting the incidence study. A total of 726 (70%) out of
the 1043 eligible police participated in the incidence study.The overall HIV-1
prevalence was 65/1240 (5.2%). Females had a non-statistically significant higher
prevalence of HIV infection compared to males 19/253, (7.5%) vs. 46/987 (4.7%)
respectively (p = 0.07). The overall incidence of HIV-1 was 8.4 per 1000 PYAR
(95% CI 4.68-14.03), and by gender was 8.8 and 6.9 per 1000 PYAR, among males and
females respectively, (p = 0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: The HIV prevalence and incidence among the studied police has
declined over the past 10 years, and therefore this cohort is better suited for
phase I/II HIV vaccine studies than for efficacy trials.

Pattern of occurrence and treatment of impacted teeth at the Muhimbili National
Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Msagati F, Simon EN, Owibingire S.

BACKGROUND: Impacted teeth predispose to periodontal disease and dental caries of
adjacent second teeth resulting in pain, discomfort and loss of function. This
study analyzed the pattern of occurrence of impacted teeth, associated symptoms, 
treatment and complications of treatment in patients who presented at the
Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania.
METHOD: This was a crossectional descriptive study which utilized notes and x
rays of patients who were treated for impacted teeth at the Oral and
Maxillofacial firm in Muhimbili National Hospital over five years, from January
2005 to August 2010. These records were retrieved and examined for the major
complaint of the patient at presentation to hospital, demography, impacted tooth,
type of impaction (for third molars), treatment offered and complications after
treatment. Similar information was collected from all patients with impacted
teeth attended in the same centre from 1st September 2010 to 31st August 2011.
RESULTS: A total of 896 patients (496 males and 400 females) treated for
complaints related to impacted teeth were recorded. The male to female ratio was 
1.2:1, age range of 16 to 85 years and a mean age of 28.9 years (SD =
9.5).Slightly more than 84% of the patients presented with mandibular third molar
impactions. Most (44.7%) of these patients had an impacted lower right third
molar followed by those presenting with a lower left third molar impaction
(39.7%). In 1.3% of the patients all the four third molars were impacted. Sixty
nine (7.7%) patients had impacted upper 3rd molars while 2% had impacted upper
canines. Of the mandibular 3rd molar impactions 738 (76%) were mesio-angular
type, 87 (8.9%) horizontal type and 69 (7.1%) disto-angular.Patients presented
with a variety of complaints. About 85% of the patients presented to hospital due
to varying degrees of pain. In 4.9% the detection of the impacted tooth/teeth was
coincidental after presenting to hospital for other reasons not related to the
impaction.Majority of the patients with impacted mandibular third molars had
carious lesions on the impacted teeth, neighbouring tooth or both. Four hundred
and five (45.2%) patients had a carious lesion on one of the impacted teeth while
201(22.4%) patients had a carious lesion on the adjacent second molar. In 122
(13.6%) patients both the impacted third molar and the adjacent second molar were
carious. In twelve patients who presented with a main complaint of fracture of
the angle of the mandible there was an associated impacted 3rd molar. Eight
hundred and fifteen (91%) patients with impacted teeth were treated by surgical
removal. Among these only 15 (1.8%) had complications that ranged from excessive 
swellings, trismus and severe pain post operatively. One patient was reported to 
have fracture of the angle of the mandible sustained during surgical removal of
an impacted 48.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with impacted teeth were young with an
almost equal sex distribution. The most commonly impacted teeth were mandibular
third molars followed by the maxillary third molars. Patients with impacted teeth
reported for health care predominantly because of pain due to dental caries or
infection.There is a need of creating appropriate programmes that would further
raise peoples' awareness to regular dental checkups so that appropriate measures 
are taken before complications arise.

The internal migration between public and faith-based health providers: a
cross-sectional, retrospective and multicentre study from southern Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude, direction and underlying dynamics of internal
health worker migration between public and faith-based health providers from a
hospital perspective.
METHODS: Two complementary tools were implemented in 10 public and six
faith-based hospitals in southern Tanzania. A hospital questionnaire assessed
magnitude and direction of staff migration between January 2006 and June 2009.
Interviews with 42 public and 20 faith-based maternity nurses evaluated
differences in staff perspectives and motives for the observed migration
patterns.
RESULTS: The predominant direction of staff movement was from the faith-based to 
the public sector: 69.1% (n = 105/152) of hospital staff exits and 60.6% (n =
60/99) of hospital staff gains. Nurses were the largest group among the migrating
health workforce. Faith-based hospitals lost 59.3% (n = 86/145) of nurses and
90.6% (n = 77/85) of registered nurses to the public sector, whereby public
hospitals reported 13.5% (n = 59/436) of nurses and 24.4% (n = 41/168) of
registered nurses being former faith-based employees. Interviews revealed
significantly inferior staff perspectives among faith-based respondents than
their public colleagues. Main differences were identified regarding career
development and training, management support, employee engagement and workload.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed considerable internal health worker migration
from the faith-based to the public sector. Staff retention and motivation within 
faith-based hospitals are not restricted to financial considerations, and salary 
gaps can no longer uniquely explain this movement pattern. The consequences for
the catchment area of faith-based hospitals are potentially severe and erode
cooperation potential between the public and private health sector.

Chikungunya virus infection: an overview.

Caglioti C, Lalle E, Castilletti C, Carletti F, Capobianchi MR, Bordi L.

Laboratory of Virology, "L. Spallanzani" National Institute for Infectious
Diseases, Rome, Italy.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus belonging to the
Togaviridae family, first isolated in Tanzania in 1952. The main vectors are
mosquitoes from the Aedes species. Recently, the establishment of an envelope
mutation increased infectivity for A. albopictus. CHIKV has recently re-emerged
causing millions of infections in countries around the Indian Ocean characterized
by climate conditions favourable to high vector density. Importation of human
cases to European regions with high density of suitable arthropod vectors (such
as A. albopictus) may trigger autochthonous outbreaks. The clinical signs of
CHIKV infection include non-specific flu-like symptoms, and a characteristic rash
accompanied by joint pain that may last for a long time after the resolution of
the infection. The death rate is not particularly high, but excess mortality has 
been observed in concomitance with large CHIKV outbreaks. Deregulation of innate 
defense mechanisms, such as cytokine inflammatory response, may participate in
the main clinical signs of CHIKV infection, and the establishment of persistent
(chronic) disease. There is no specific therapy, and prevention is the main
countermeasure. Prevention is based on insect control and in avoiding mosquito
bites in endemic countries. Diagnosis is based on the detection of virus by
molecular methods or by virus culture on the first days of infection, and by
detection of an immune response in later stages. CHIKV infection must be
suspected in patients with compatible clinical symptoms returning from
epidemic/endemic areas. Differential diagnosis should take into account the
cross-reactivity with other viruses from the same antigenic complex (i.e.
O'nyong-nyong virus).

Characterising women with obstetric fistula and urogenital tract injuries in
Tanzania.

Siddle K, Vieren L, Fiander A.

Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, Wales, UK.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: World Health Organisation (WHO) data suggest that
more than two million women and girls live with fistula and that an additional
50-100,000 are newly affected each year. In Tanzania, it has been estimated that 
there are between 1,200 and 3,000 new cases of obstetric fistula annually.
METHODS: To characterize women undergoing surgery in 2011 for obstetric fistula
repair at a disability hospital associated with Comprehensive Community Based
Rehabilitation in Tanzania (CCBRT), we identified routinely collected data and
input into an Access database.
RESULTS: Women affected by obstetric fistulae in Tanzania are frequently young,
poorly educated, primiparous, subsistence farmers or housewives and have
experienced obstructed labour as a result of delays occurring at home and/or
after reaching a health facility. The majority experienced stillbirth,
particularly in cases of assisted or operative delivery. Success rates for
fistula closure were high, at 91Â %, but residual incontinence on discharge from
hospital was seen in 39Â %.
CONCLUSIONS: Longer-term follow-up is required to determine rates of disabling
residual incontinence and to examine demographics in greater depth, including
variation between regions and in urban, periurban and rural settings in Tanzania.

Mini-FLOTAC and Kato-Katz: helminth eggs watching on the shore of Lake Victoria.

Beatrice.barda@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: One of the challenges for monitoring helminth control programmes
based on preventive chemotherapy is the lack of a copro-parasitological
gold-standard method that combines good sensitivity with quantitative
performance, low cost, and easy-to-learn technique.The aim of our study was to
evaluate and compare, the WHO recommended quantitative diagnostic technique
(Kato-Katz) and the Mini-FLOTAC.
METHODS: Mini-FLOTAC is an innovative method based on floatation of helminths
eggs with two different solutions (FS2 and FS7) using a close system
(Fill-FLOTAC) with 5% fixative. Kato-Katz was performed following WHO
recommendation. The study was carried out in a rural part of Tanzania, close to
Lake Victoria, where the laboratory facilities are fairly scarce, and the basic
technique used in the local laboratory (direct smear) was taken as reference
standard.
RESULTS: 201 children were screened for intestinal helminths and 91% of them were
found to be positive. The agreement among the three techniques was calculated
with k Cohen coefficient and was fairly good (kâ€‰=â€‰0.4), although the Mini-FLOTAC 
results were more sensitive for hookworm (98%) with FS2, and for S.mansoni (90%) 
with FS7 followed by Kato-Katz (91% and 60% respectively) and direct smear (30%
and 10% respectively). A good agreement was found between Mini-FLOTAC and
Kato-Katz (kâ€‰= 0.81) with FS7 (kâ€‰=â€‰0.76) for hookworm diagnosis and a fairly good
one for S.mansoni diagnosis (kâ€‰=â€‰0.5). For both infections we had a poor
agreement between the two quantitative techniques and the direct smear (k<0.3).
Kato-Katz diagnosed a higher number of eggs (calculated by arithmetic mean) both 
for hookworm (455 vs 424 EPG) and for S.mansoni (71 vs 58 EPG) compared with the 
Mini-FLOTAC, but the differences were not significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Mini-FLOTAC is a promising technique, comparable and as sensitive as
the Kato-Katz, which is the recommended method in intestinal helminthology for
monitoring helminth control programmes. A comparative advantage of the
Mini-FLOTAC is that it comprises of a closed system with preserved samples that
both protects the operators and allows subsequent examination of the samples.
Further studies are needed to validate the mini-FLOTAC with other quantitative
techniques (McMaster) and in different settings where other soil-transmitted
helminths are also endemic.

RJ, Ross DA.

Research Degree Student, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.

BACKGROUND: With effective contraceptives available, unplanned pregnancies are
preventable and educational interventions have been cited as a promising platform
to increase contraceptive use through improving knowledge. However, results from 
trials of educational interventions have been disappointing. In order to
effectively target future interventions, this study aimed to identify risk
factors for unplanned pregnancy among young women in Mwanza, Tanzania.
METHODS: Data were analysed from the MEMA kwa Vijiana Trial Long-term Evaluation 
Survey, a cross-sectional study of 13&emsp14;814 young adults aged
15-30&emsp14;years in Mwanza, Tanzania. Potential risk factors for unplanned
pregnancy were grouped under three headings: socio-demographic, knowledge of and 
attitude towards sexual health, and sexual behaviour and contraceptive use.
Conditional logistic regression was used to identify predictors of reported
unplanned pregnancy among all sexually active women.
RESULTS: Increasing age, lower educational level, not being currently married,
knowing where to access condoms, increasing number of sexual partners and younger
reported age at sexual debut were associated with unplanned pregnancy.
DISCUSSION: A number of demographic and sexual behaviour risk factors for
pregnancy are identified which will help guide future intervention programmes
aiming to reduce unplanned pregnancies. This study suggests effective measures to
prevent unplanned pregnancies should focus on encouraging girls to stay in
school.

Perspective of an advocate: best practices for Community Outreach Advocacy.

Kandusi EJ.

Tanzania 50 Plus Campaign, Tanzania. ekandusi@yahoo.com.

Of all the different types of advocacy, Community Outreach Advocacy (COA) is the 
best methodology. This methodology is the prolegomena to the achievement of all
other advocacies including political, fundraising, research, support and
education. This is because the outcome of COA awareness work is an informed group
of people. Such people can comprehend and tackle any other initiatives in
addressing the issue at stake and so prevent and control unnecessary suffering
and deaths caused by cancer! At the end of the day, the African Cancer Advocates 
Consortium (ACAC) will achieve its mission to "Make Cancer a Top Priority in
Africa" through informed people.

Histomorphometrical and ultrastructural study of the effects of carbendazim on
the magnum of the Japanese quail (<i>Coturnix coturnix japonica</i>).

The study investigated the effect of various doses of carbendazim on the
morphology of the magnum of the Japanese quail. No morphological changes were
observed in the magnum in birds treated with carbendazim at doses of 25 mg/kg and
100 mg/kg bodyweight. A carbendazim dose of 400 mg/kg bodyweight was the lowest
dose which caused morphological changes in the magnum. Histologically,
carbendazim caused pyknosis and glandular atrophy in the magnum mucosa.
Carbendazim also caused significant decreases in the height of the mucosal folds,
epithelial height, glandular width and glandular luminal diameter at 400 mg/kg
and 800 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.05). At ultrastructural level, dose-dependent deciliation
was observed. Pyknotic nuclei, dilated cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum, 
swollen mitochondria, numerous vacuoles and lysosomes in the luminal and
glandular epithelia were identified. The observed degenerative changes could be
due to cytoskeletal disruption caused by carbendazim toxicity. Degeneration of
the luminal and glandular cells in the magnum pose a potential threat to the egg 
production and reproduction of exposed birds.

Responding to medical crises: AIDS treatment, responsibilisation and the logic of
choice.

Beckmann N.

Life Sciences, University of Roehampton, London, UK.
nadine.beckmann@roehampton.ac.uk

The framing of HIV/AIDS as a crisis has facilitated the rollout of large-scale
intervention programmes that represent an enormous effort at mainstreaming
biomedical rationalities and neoliberal notions of responsibilisation and
self-care. Based on a 'logic of choice' (Mol 2008) and 'responsibilised
citizenship' (Robins 2005a), although veiled in a language of rights and
partnership, the heavy focus on individual behaviour and a pharmaceutical
'solution' to AIDS shifts the burden of responsibility for the success of the
heavily funded programmes onto the shoulders of the patients and conceals
alternative forms of responsibility. Analysing how HIV-positive people in
Tanzania navigate life with HIV and the complex treatment regimens, this paper
looks beyond biomedical rationality, which places the preservation of individual 
biological life at the centre of its logic, and analyses people's constant
struggle to negotiate the meaning of 'responsible behaviour' in the context of
their lived realities. This repositions the notion of responsibility in the realm
of the social and reveals the rationality behind apparently irrational practices.

Being tough, being healthy: local forms of counselling in response to adult death
in northwest Tanzania.

de Klerk J.

a Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology , University of Amsterdam ,
Amsterdam , The Netherlands.

While antiretroviral medicines have reduced AIDS-related deaths in sub-Saharan
Africa, many people still lose multiple family members and struggle with the
social and economic consequences of those deaths. This paper examines how older
Tanzanians frame feelings of loss caused by the untimely death of young adults
and how they advise other bereaved about how to manage loss. A local concept
oyegumisilize - meaning 'to move on and push grief and worries aside' - is
employed in offering bereaved persons advice about how to deal with feelings of
loss. Older people try hard to manage memories of loss whilst simultaneously
struggling to fulfil the social obligations around mourning that contribute to
their ongoing bereavement. Oyegumisilize can be seen as a counselling practice
that helps those who have lost loved ones to move on with life and feel normal.
It is argued that this form of counselling is a form of therapeutic speech, where
the emphasis is not on 'talking through' emotions, but on speech that is aimed at
'toughening up' the bereaved person. The findings presented here are based upon
ethnographic research undertaken in Muleba District in Kagera Region, Tanzania,
between 2003 and 2004, and follow-up research conducted in 2005, 2008 and 2012.

A case of huge primary leiomyoma of the ureter in which nephroureterectomy was
performed is presented. To the best of our knowledge, this case is a unique form 
of leiomyoma of the ureter due to its large size. There have been only twelve
cases of primary leiomyoma of the ureter reported since 1955 and eleven of them
were very small and one was big in size but smaller than the present case. Our
case is considered to be the thirteenth.

The costs of accessible quality assured syphilis diagnostics: informing quality
systems for rapid syphilis tests in a Tanzanian setting.

OBJECTIVES To determine the costs of Rapid Syphilis Test (RSTs) as compared with 
rapid plasma reagin (RPR) when implemented in a Tanzanian setting, and to
determine the relative impact of a quality assurance (QA) system on the cost of
RST implementation. METHODS The incremental costs for RPR and RST screening
programmes in existing antenatal care settings in Geita District, Tanzania were
collected for 9 months in subsequent years from nine health facilities that
varied in size, remoteness and scope of antenatal services. The costs per woman
tested and treated were estimated for each facility. A sensitivity analysis was
constructed to determine the impact of parameter and model uncertainty.Findings
In surveyed facilities, a total of 6362 women were tested with RSTs compared with
224 tested with RPR. The range of unit costs was $1.76-$3.13 per woman screened
and $12.88-$32.67 per woman treated. Unit costs for the QA system came to $0.51
per woman tested, of which 50% were attributed to salaries and transport for
project personnel. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that rapid syphilis
diagnostics are very inexpensive in this setting and can overcome some critical
barriers to ensuring universal access to syphilis testing and treatment. The
additional costs for implementation of a quality system were found to be
relatively small, and could be reduced through alterations to the programme
design. Given the potential for a quality system to improve quality of diagnosis 
and care, we recommend that QA activities be incorporated into RST roll-out.

Sciences, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Futures Group, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND Many clients of HIV care and treatment services have unmet
contraceptive needs. Integrating family planning (FP) services into HIV services 
is an increasingly utilized strategy for meeting those unmet needs. However,
numerous models for services integration are potentially applicable for clients
with diverse health needs. This study developed and tested a 'facilitated
referral' model for integrating FP into HIV care and treatment in Tanzania with
the primary outcome being a reduction in unmet need for contraception among
female clients. METHODS The facilitated referral model included seven distinct
steps for service providers. A quasi-experimental, pre- and post-test, repeated
cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the impact of the model. Female
clients at 12 HIV care and treatment clinics (CTCs) were interviewed pre- and
post-intervention and CTC providers were interviewed post-intervention. RESULTS A
total of 323 CTC clients were interviewed pre-intervention and 299 were
interviewed post-intervention. Among all clients, the adjusted decrease in
proportion with unmet need (3%) was not significant (P = 0.103) but among only
sexually active clients, the adjusted decrease (8%) approached significance (P = 
0.052). Furthermore, the proportion of sexually active clients using a
contraceptive method post-intervention increased by an estimated 12% (P = 0.013).
Dual method use increased by 16% (P = 0.004). Increases were observed for all
seven steps of the model from pre- to post-intervention. All providers (n = 45)
stated that FP integration was a good addition although there were implementation
challenges.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the facilitated referral
model is a feasible strategy for integrating FP into HIV care and treatment
services. The findings show that this model resulted in increased contraceptive
use among HIV-positive female clients. By highlighting the distinct steps
necessary for facilitated referrals, this study can help inform both programmes
and future research efforts in services integration.

SUMMARY Rapid and wide dispersal of passengers after flights makes investigation 
of flight-related outbreaks challenging. An outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg was
identified in a group of Irish travellers returning from Tanzania. Additional
international cases sharing the same flight were identified. Our aim was to
determine the source and potential vehicles of infection. Case-finding utilized
information exchange using experts' communication networks and national
surveillance systems. Demographic, clinical and food history information was
collected. Twenty-five additional cases were identified from Ireland, The
Netherlands, Norway, USA and Canada. We conducted a case-control study which
indicated a significant association between illness and consumption of milk tart 
(OR 10·2) and an egg dish (OR 6) served on-board the flight. No food consumed
before the flight was associated with illness. Cases from countries other than
Ireland provided supplementary information that facilitated the identification of
likely vehicles of infection. Timely, committed international collaboration is
vital in such investigations.

Coelacanths are known as "living fossils," as they show remarkable morphological 
resemblance to the fossil record and belong to the most primitive lineage of
living Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods). Coelacanths may be key
to elucidating the tempo and mode of evolution from fish to tetrapods. Here, we
report the genome sequences of five coelacanths, including four Latimeria
chalumnae individuals (three specimens from Tanzania and one from Comoros) and
one L. menadoensis individual from Indonesia. These sequences cover two African
breeding populations and two known extant coelacanth species. The genome is âˆ¼2.74
Gbp and contains a high proportion (âˆ¼60%) of repetitive elements. The genetic
diversity among the individuals was extremely low, suggesting a small population 
size and/or a slow rate of evolution. We found a substantial number of genes that
encode olfactory and pheromone receptors with features characteristic of tetrapod
receptors for the detection of airborne ligands. We also found that limb
enhancers of bmp7 and gli3, both of which are essential for limb formation, are
conserved between coelacanth and tetrapods, but not ray-finned fishes. We expect 
that some tetrapod-like genes may have existed early in the evolution of
primitive Sarcopterygii and were later co-opted to adapt to terrestrial
environments. These coelacanth genomes will provide a cornerstone for studies to 
elucidate how ancestral aquatic vertebrates evolved into terrestrial animals.

Children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are the least touched by
recent successes in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS globally. Early
treatment is essential for a child's longer and higher quality of life; however, 
by 2011, only a small proportion of HIV-seropositive children in LMIC countries
were receiving treatment, in part because of persisting low rates of diagnosis.
This study of the prevalence and characteristics of children tested for HIV was
embedded in the Coping with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania (CHAT) study in which
HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative adults, and adults with unknown HIV status 
were asked about HIV testing for their children. Data were gathered from November
2009 to August 2010 during the scale-up of Prevention of Mother To Child
Transmission and Early Infant Diagnosis programs in the region. Reports on 1776
children indicate that 31.7% of all children were reported to have been tested,
including only 42.9% of children with an HIV-seropositive caregiver. In general, 
children more likely to be HIV tested were biological children of study
participants, younger, of widowed adults, living in urban areas, and of
HIV-seropositive parents/caregivers. Children belonging to the two indigenous
tribes, Chagga and Pare, were more likely to be tested than those from other
tribes. Rates of testing among children less than two years old were low, even
for the HIV-seropositive caregiver group. The persistence of low testing rates is
discussed in terms of the accessibility and acceptability of child testing in
resource poor settings.

INTRODUCTION: The syndrome of fever is a commonly presenting complaint among
persons seeking healthcare in low-resource areas, yet the public health community
has not approached fever in a comprehensive manner. In many areas, malaria is
over-diagnosed, and patients without malaria have poor outcomes.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We prospectively studied a cohort of 870 pediatric and
adult febrile admissions to two hospitals in northern Tanzania over the period of
one year using conventional standard diagnostic tests to establish fever
etiology. Malaria was the clinical diagnosis for 528 (60.7%), but was the actual 
cause of fever in only 14 (1.6%). By contrast, bacterial, mycobacterial, and
fungal bloodstream infections accounted for 85 (9.8%), 14 (1.6%), and 25 (2.9%)
febrile admissions, respectively. Acute bacterial zoonoses were identified among 
118 (26.2%) of febrile admissions; 16 (13.6%) had brucellosis, 40 (33.9%)
leptospirosis, 24 (20.3%) had Q fever, 36 (30.5%) had spotted fever group
rickettsioses, and 2 (1.8%) had typhus group rickettsioses. In addition, 55
(7.9%) participants had a confirmed acute arbovirus infection, all due to
chikungunya. No patient had a bacterial zoonosis or an arbovirus infection
included in the admission differential diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria was uncommon and over-diagnosed, whereas invasive infections
were underappreciated. Bacterial zoonoses and arbovirus infections were highly
prevalent yet overlooked. An integrated approach to the syndrome of fever in
resource-limited areas is needed to improve patient outcomes and to rationally
target disease control efforts.

OBJECTIVES: To prepare for future HIV prevention trials, we conducted prospective
cohort studies among women working in food and recreational facilities in
northern Tanzania. We examined the prevalence and incidence of HIV and HSV-2, and
associated risk factors.
METHODS: Women aged 18-44 years working in food and recreational facilities were 
screened to determine their eligibility for the studies. Between 2008-2010,
HIV-negative women were enrolled and followed for 12 months. At enrolment and
3-monthly, we collected socio-demographic and behavioural data, and performed
clinical examinations for collection of biological specimens that were tested for
reproductive tract infections. Risk factors for HIV and HSV-2 incidence were
investigated using Poisson regression models.
RESULTS: We screened 2,229 and enrolled 1,378 women. The median age was 27 years 
(interquartile range, IQR 22, 33), and median duration working at current
facility was 2 years. The prevalences of HIV at screening and HSV-2 at enrolment 
were 16% and 67%, respectively. Attendance at the 12-month visit was 86%. HIV and
HSV-2 incidence rates were 3.7 (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.8,5.1) and 28.6
(95% CI: 23.5,35.0)/100 person-years, respectively. Women who were separated,
divorced, or widowed were at increased risk of HIV (adjusted incidence rate
ratio, aRRâ€Š=â€Š6.63; 95% CI: 1.97,22.2) and HSV-2 (aRRâ€Š=â€Š2.00; 95% CI: 1.15,3.47)
compared with married women. Women reporting â‰¥3 partners in the past 3 months
were at higher HIV risk compared with women with 0-1 partner (aRRâ€Š=â€Š4.75; 95% CI:
2.10,10.8), while those who had reached secondary education or above were at
lower risk of HSV-2 compared with women with incomplete primary education
(aRRâ€Š=â€Š0.42; 95% CI: 0.22,0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV and HSV-2 rates remain substantially higher in this cohort than 
in the general population, indicating urgent need for effective interventions.
These studies demonstrate the feasibility of conducting trials to test new
interventions in this highly-mobile population.

Characteristics of latrines in central Tanzania and their relation to fly
catches.

Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.

The disposal of human excreta in latrines is an important step in reducing the
transmission of diarrhoeal diseases. However, in latrines, flies can access the
latrine contents and serve as a mechanical transmitter of diarrhoeal pathogens.
Furthermore, the latrine contents can be used as a breeding site for flies, which
may further contribute to disease transmission. Latrines do not all produce
flies, and there are some which produce only a few, while others can produce
thousands. In order to understand the role of the latrine in determining this
productivity, a pilot study was conducted, in which fifty latrines were observed 
in and around Ifakara, Tanzania. The characteristics of the latrine
superstructure, use of the latrine, and chemical characteristics of pit latrine
contents were compared to the numbers of flies collected in an exit trap placed
over the drop hole in the latrine. Absence of a roof was found to have a
significant positive association (t=3.17, p=0.003) with the total number of flies
collected, and temporary superstructures, particularly as opposed to brick
superstructures (z=4.26, p<0.001), and increased total solids in pit latrines
(z=2.57, p=0.01) were significantly associated with increased numbers of
blowflies leaving the latrine. The number of larvae per gram was significantly
associated with the village from which samples were taken, with the largest
difference between two villages outside Ifakara (z=2.12, p=0.03). The effect of
latrine superstructure (roof, walls) on fly production may indicate that
improvements in latrine construction could result in decreases in fly populations
in areas where they transmit diarrhoeal pathogens.

Infectious diseases are widely presumed to be one of the greatest threats to ape 
conservation in the wild. Human diseases are of particular concern, and the costs
and benefits of human presence in protected areas with apes are regularly
debated. While numerous syndromes with fatal outcomes have recently been
described, precise identification of pathogens remains difficult. These
diagnostic difficulties are compounded by the fact that direct veterinary
intervention on wild apes is quite rare. Here we present the unique case of a
wild chimpanzee at Gombe National Park that was observed with a severe illness
and was subsequently examined and treated in the field. Multiple specimens were
collected and tested with the aim of identifying the pathogen responsible for the
illness. Our findings represent the first extensive screening of a living wild
chimpanzee, yet despite our efforts, the cause and source of illness remain
unknown. Nevertheless, our findings represent valuable baseline data for the ape 
conservation community and for comparison with other recent findings. In
addition, we present the case here to demonstrate the planning required and
multiple types of expertise necessary to maximize the amount of data obtained
from such a rare intervention, and to provide lessons learned for future studies.

CenteringPregnancy-Africa: A pilot of group antenatal care to address Millennium 
Development Goals.

BACKGROUND: severe health worker shortages and resource limitations negatively
affect quality of antenatal care (ANC) throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Group ANC, 
specifically CenteringPregnancy (CP), may offer an innovative approach to enable 
midwives to offer higher quality ANC.
OBJECTIVE: our overarching goal was to prepare to conduct a clinical trial of
CenteringPregnancy-Africa (CP-Africa) in Malawi and Tanzania. In Phase 1, our
goal was to determine the acceptability of CP as a model for ANC in both
countries. In Phase 2, our objective was to develop CP-Africa session content
consistent with the Essential Elements of CP model and with national standards in
both Malawi and Tanzania. In Phase 3, our objective was to pilot CP-Africa in
Malawi to determine whether sessions could be conducted with fidelity to the
Centering process.
SETTING: Phases 1 and 2 took place in Malawi and Tanzania. Phase 3, the piloting 
of two sessions of CP-Africa, occurred at two sites in Malawi: a district
hospital and a small clinic.
DESIGN: we used an Action Research approach to promote partnerships among
university researchers, the Centering Healthcare Institute, health care
administrators, health professionals and women attending ANC to develop CP-Africa
session content and pilot this model of group ANC.
PARTICIPANTS: for Phases 1 and 2, members of the Ministries of Health, health
professionals and pregnant women in Malawi and Tanzania were introduced to and
interviewed about CP. In Phase 2, we finalised CP-Africa content and trained 13
health professionals in the Centering Healthcare model. In Phase 3, we conducted 
a small pilot with 24 pregnant women (12 at each site).
MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: participants enthusiastically embraced CP-Africa as an
acceptable model of ANC health care delivery. The CP-Africa content met both CP
and national standards. The pilot established that the CP model could be
implemented with process fidelity to the 13 Essential Elements. Several
implementation challenges and strategies to address these challenges were
identified.
KEY CONCLUSIONS: preliminary data suggest that CP-Africa is feasible in
resource-constrained, low-literacy, high-HIV settings in sub-Saharan Africa. By
improving the quality of ANC delivery, midwives have an opportunity to make a
contribution towards Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targeting improvements in
child, maternal and HIV-related health outcomes (MDGs 4, 5 and 6). A clinical
trial is needed to establish efficacy.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: CP-Africa also has the potential to reduce job-related
stress and enhance job satisfaction for midwives in low income countries. If CP
can be transferred with fidelity to process in sub-Saharan Africa and retain
similar results to those reported in clinical trials, it has the potential to
benefit pregnant women and their infants and could make a positive contribution
to MGDs 4, 5 and 6.

BACKGROUND: The use of supply-side incentives to increase health service
utilisation and enhance service quality is gaining momentum in many low- and
middle-income countries. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the impact of
such schemes, their cost-effectiveness, and the process of implementation and
potential unintended consequences in these settings. A pay for performance (P4P) 
programme was introduced in Pwani region of Tanzania in 2011.
METHODS/DESIGN: An evaluation of the programme will be carried out to inform a
potential national rollout. A controlled before and after study will examine the 
effect of the P4P programme on quality, coverage, and cost of targeted maternal
and newborn healthcare services and selected non-targeted services at facilities 
in Tanzania. Data will be collected from a survey of 75 facilities, 750 patients 
exiting consultations, over 75 health workers, and 1,500 households of women who 
delivered in the previous year, in all seven intervention districts. Data will be
collected from the same number of respondents in four control districts. A
process evaluation will examine: whether the P4P programme was implemented as
planned; stakeholder response to the programme and its acceptability; and
implementation bottlenecks and facilitating factors. Three rounds of process data
collection will be conducted including a review of available P4P documents,
individual interviews and focus group discussions with key informants working at 
facility and district level in five of the intervention districts, and at the
regional and national levels. An economic evaluation will measure the
cost-effectiveness of P4P relative to current practice from a societal
perspective.
DISCUSSION: This evaluation will contribute robust evidence on the impact and
cost-effectiveness of P4P in a low income setting, as well as generate a better
understanding of the feasibility of integrating complex intervention packages
like P4P within health systems in resource poor settings.

Lymphatic filariasis control in Tanzania: effect of six rounds of mass drug
administration with ivermectin and albendazole on infection and transmission.

Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 57, 1871 Frederiksberg C,
Denmark. pesi@sund.ku.dk

BACKGROUND: Control of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in most countries of sub-Saharan
Africa is based on annual mass drug administration (MDA) with a combination of
ivermectin and albendazole, in order to interrupt transmission. We present
findings from a detailed study on the effect of six rounds of MDA with this drug 
combination as implemented by the National Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination
Programme (NLFEP) in a highly endemic rural area of north-eastern Tanzania.
METHODS: The effect of treatment on transmission and human infection was
monitored in a community- and a school-based study during an 8-year period (one
pre-intervention and 7 post-intervention years) from 2003 to 2011.
RESULTS: Before intervention, 24.5% of the community population had microfilariae
(mf) in the blood, 53.3% had circulating filarial antigens (CFA) and 78.9% had
specific antibodies to the recombinant filarial antigen Bm14. One year after the 
sixth MDA, these values had decreased considerably to 2.7%, 19.6% and 27.5%,
respectively. During the same period, the CFA prevalence among new intakes of
Standard 1 pupils in 10 primary schools decreased from 25.2% to 5.6%. In line
with this, transmission by the three vectors (Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus and
Culex quinquefasciatus) as determined by dissection declined sharply (overall
vector infectivity rate by 99.3% and mean monthly transmission potential by 99.2%
between pre-intervention and fifth post-intervention period). A major shift in
vector species composition, from predominantly anopheline to almost exclusively
culicine was observed over the years. This may be largely unrelated to the MDAs
but may have important implications for the epidemiology of LF in the area.
CONCLUSIONS: Six MDAs caused considerable decrease in all the measured indices
for transmission and human infection. In spite of this, indices were still
relatively high in the late period of the study, and it may take a long time to
reach the recommended cut-off levels for interruption of transmission unless
extra efforts are made. These should include increased engagement of the target
population in the control activities, to ensure higher treatment coverage. It is 
expected that the recent initiative to distribute insecticide impregnated bed
nets to every household in the area will also contribute towards reaching the
goal of successful LF elimination.

The use of IV-tubing as a closed-suction drainage system during neurosurgical
cases in Tanzania.

Bonfield CM, Shabani HK, Kanumba ES, Ellegala DB, Nicholas J.

Department of Neurological Surgery, Presbyterian University Hospital, Pittsburgh,
PA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Commercial closed-suctions drainage systems are commonly used in the 
United States and many other countries for use in neurosurgical cases. However,
in Tanzania and other developing nations with fewer resources, these are not
available. This report explores another option for a closed-system drainage
system utilizing inexpensive supplies found commonly in hospitals around the
world.
METHODS: Sterile IV-tubing is cut, inserted into the wound, and brought out
through an adjacent puncture incision. For suction, an empty plastic bottle can
be attached to the tubing.
RESULTS: The IV-tubing closed-suction drainage system was applied in both cranial
and spinal neurosurgical procedures, including as subdural, subgaleal, epidural, 
and suprafacial drains. It maintained suction and was an adequate substitute when
commercial drains are unavailable.
CONCLUSIONS: This report illustrates how sterile IV-tubing can be adapted for use
as a closed-drainage system. It utilizes inexpensive supplies commonly found in
many hospitals throughout the world and can be applied to both cranial and spinal
neurosurgical procedures.

pseth@cdc.gov.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of depressive symptoms among people living 
with HIV (PLHIV) is considerably greater than that among members of the general
population. It is particularly important to treat depressive symptoms among PLHIV
because they have been associated with poorer HIV care-related outcomes. This
study describes overall psychosocial functioning and factors associated with
depressive symptoms among PLHIV attending HIV care and treatment clinics in
Kenya, Namibia, and Tanzania. Eighteen HIV care and treatment clinics (six per
country) enrolled approximately 200 HIV-positive patients (for a total of 3,538
participants) and collected data on patients' physical and mental well-being,
medical/health status, and psychosocial functioning. Although the majority of
participants did not report clinically significant depressive symptoms (72 %),
28 % reported mild to severe depressive symptoms, with 12 % reporting severe
depressive symptoms. Regression models indicated that greater levels of
depressive symptoms were associated with: (1) being female, (2) younger age, (3) 
not being completely adherent to HIV medications, (4) likely dependence on
alcohol, (5) disclosure to three or more people (versus one person), (6)
experiences of recent violence, (7) less social support, and (8) poorer physical 
functioning. Participants from Kenya and Namibia reported greater depressive
symptoms than those from Tanzania. Approximately 28 % of PLHIV reported
clinically significant depressive symptoms. The scale-up of care and treatment
services in sub-Saharan Africa provides an opportunity to address psychosocial
and mental health needs for PLHIV as part of comprehensive care.

Self-reported occupational exposure to HIV and factors influencing its management
practice: a study of healthcare workers in Tumbi and Dodoma Hospitals, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Blood borne infectious agents such as hepatitis B virus (HBV),
hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immune deficiency virus (HIV) constitute a
major occupational hazard for healthcare workers (HCWs). To some degree it is
inevitable that HCWs sustain injuries from sharp objects such as needles,
scalpels and splintered bone during execution of their duties. However, in
Tanzania, there is little or no information on factors that influence the
practice of managing occupational exposure to HIV by HCWs. This study was
conducted to determine the prevalence of self-reported occupational exposure to
HIV among HCWs and explore factors that influence the practice of managing
occupational exposure to HIV by HCWs in Tanzania.
METHODS: Self-administered questionnaire was designed to gather information of
healthcare workers' occupational exposures in the past 12 months and
circumstances in which these injuries occurred. Practice of managing occupational
exposure was assessed by the following questions:
RESULTS: Nearly half of the HCWs had experienced at least one occupational injury
in the past 12 months. Though most of the occupational exposures to HIV were
experienced by female nurses, non-medical hospital staff received PEP more
frequently than nurses and doctors. Doctors and nurses frequently encountered
occupational injuries in surgery room and labor room respectively. HCWs with
knowledge on the possibility of HIV transmission and those who knew whom to
contact in event of occupational exposure to HIV were less likely to have poor
practice of managing occupational exposure.
CONCLUSION: Needle stick injuries and splashes are common among HCWs at Tumbi and
Dodoma hospitals. Knowledge of the risk of HIV transmission due to occupational
exposure and knowing whom to contact in event of exposure predicted practice of
managing the exposure. Thus provision of health education on occupational
exposure may strengthen healthcare workers' practices to manage occupational
exposure.

Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: To confirm whether 7 days of phenytoin, an enzyme inducer, would
decrease the elimination half-life of single-dose nevirapine and to investigate
its effect on the development of nevirapine resistance in pregnant, HIV-infected 
women.
METHODS: In a pharmacokinetic pilot trial (NCT01187719), HIV-infected,
antiretroviral (ARV)-naive pregnant women â‰¥18 years old from Zambia and Tanzania 
and with CD4 cell counts >350 cells/mm(3) were randomized 1â€Š:â€Š1 to a control
(zidovudine pre-delivery, single-dose nevirapine/zidovudine/lamivudine at
delivery and zidovudine/lamivudine for 7 days post-delivery) or an intervention
(control plus 184 mg of phenytoin once daily for 7 days post-delivery) group.
Primary endpoints were the pharmacokinetics of and resistance to nevirapine.
RESULTS: Thirty-five and 37 women were allocated to the control and intervention 
groups, with median (IQR) ages of 27 (23-31) and 27 (23-33) years, respectively. 
Twenty-three and 23 women had detectable nevirapine levels at delivery and
subsequent samples in the control and the intervention groups, respectively.
Geometric mean (GM) (95% CI) plasma levels of nevirapine at delivery were 1.02
(0.58-1.78) mg/L and 1.14 (0.70-1.86) mg/L in the control and intervention
groups, respectively (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.76). One week after delivery, 0/23 (0%) and 15/22
(68%) control and intervention mothers, respectively, had undetectable levels of 
nevirapine (<0.05 mg/L; P<0.001). One week later, the figures were 10/21 (48%)
and 18/19 (95%) mothers, respectively (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.002). The GM (95% CI) half-life of
nevirapine was 63.2 (52.8-75.7) versus 25.5 (21.6-30.1) h in the control group
versus the intervention group (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). New nevirapine mutations were found in
0/20 (0%) intervention-group mothers versus 1/21 (5%) control-group mothers.
Overall, there was no difference in adverse events reported between the control
and intervention arms (P > 0.28).
CONCLUSIONS: Adding 7 days of an enzyme inducer to single-dose nevirapine to
prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV significantly reduced subtherapeutic 
nevirapine levels by shortening the half-life of nevirapine. As prolonged
subtherapeutic nevirapine dosage leads to the emergence of resistance,
single-dose nevirapine could be used with phenytoin as an alternative if other
ARVs were unavailable.

Field evaluation of the Cepheid GeneXpert Chlamydia trachomatis assay for
detection of infection in a trachoma endemic community in Tanzania.

Jenson A, Dize L, Mkocha H, Munoz B, Lee J, Gaydos C, Quinn T, West SK.

Dana Center for Preventive Ophthalmology, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE: To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and field utility of the
Cepheid GeneXpert Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) Assay (GeneXpert) for ocular
chlamydia infection compared to Roche Amplicor CT assay (Amplicor).
METHODS: In a trachoma-endemic community in Kongwa Tanzania, 144 children ages 0 
to 9 were surveyed to assess clinical trachoma and had two ocular swabs taken.
One swab was processed at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD, using Amplicor,
(Roche Molecular Diagnostics) and the other swab was processed at a field station
in Kongwa using the GeneXpert Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae assay
(Cepheid). The sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert was compared to the
Amplicor assay.
RESULTS: Of the 144 swabs taken the prevalence of follicular trachoma by clinical
exam was 43.7%, and by evidence of infection according to Amplicor was 28.5%. A
total of 17 specimens (11.8%) could not be processed by GeneXpert in the field
due to lack of sample volume, other specimen issues or electricity failure. The
sensitivity of GeneXpert when compared to Amplicor was 100% and the specificity
was 95%. The GeneXpert test identified more positives in individuals with
clinical trachoma than Amplicor, 55% versus 52%.
CONCLUSION: The GeneXpert test for C. trachomatis performed with high sensitivity
and specificity and demonstrated excellent promise as a field test for trachoma
control.

Importance of ethnicity, CYP2B6 and ABCB1 genotype for efavirenz pharmacokinetics
and treatment outcomes: a parallel-group prospective cohort study in two
sub-Saharan Africa populations.

Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the importance of ethnicity and pharmacogenetic
variations in determining efavirenz pharmacokinetics, auto-induction and
immunological outcomes in two African populations.
METHODS: ART naÃ¯ve HIV patients from Ethiopia (nâ€Š=â€Š285) and Tanzania (nâ€Š=â€Š209)
were prospectively enrolled in parallel to start efavirenz based HAART. CD4+ cell
counts were determined at baseline, 12, 24 and 48 weeks. Plasma and intracellular
efavirenz and 8-hydroxyefvairenz concentrations were determined at week 4 and 16.
Genotyping for common functional CYP2B6, CYP3A5, ABCB1, UGT2B7 and SLCO1B1
variant alleles were done.
RESULT: Patient country, CYP2B6*6 and ABCB1 c.4036A>G (rs3842A>G) genotype were
significant predictors of plasma and intracellular efavirenz concentration.
CYP2B6*6 and ABCB1 c.4036A>G (rs3842) genotype were significantly associated with
higher plasma efavirenz concentration and their allele frequencies were
significantly higher in Tanzanians than Ethiopians. Tanzanians displayed
significantly higher efavirenz plasma concentration at week 4 (p<0.0002) and week
16 (pâ€Š=â€Š0.006) compared to Ethiopians. Efavirenz plasma concentrations remained
significantly higher in Tanzanians even after controlling for the effect of
CYP2B6*6 and ABCB1 c.4036A>G genotype. Within country analyses indicated a
significant decrease in the mean plasma efavirenz concentration by week 16
compared to week 4 in Tanzanians (pâ€Š=â€Š0.006), whereas no significant differences 
in plasma concentration over time was observed in Ethiopians (pâ€Š=â€Š0.84).
Intracellular efavirenz concentration and patient country were significant
predictors of CD4 gain during HAART.
CONCLUSION: We report substantial differences in efavirenz pharmacokinetics,
extent of auto-induction and immunologic recovery between Ethiopian and Tanzanian
HIV patients, partly but not solely, due to pharmacogenetic variations. The
observed inter-ethnic variations in efavirenz plasma exposure may possibly result
in varying clinical treatment outcome or adverse event profiles between
populations.

Division of Health Services Research, FHI 360, Research Triangle Park, Durham,
USA. Electronic address: dchin-quee@fhi360.org.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the accuracy of self-screening for contraindications to
combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) and to estimate the proportion of women 
with contraindications to hormonal methods among those using drug shops in
Tanzania.
METHODS: Trained nurses interviewed 1651 women aged 18-39 years who self-screened
for contraindications to COCs with the help of a poster at drug shops in
Tanzania. Nurse assessment of the women served as the gold standard for
comparison with self-assessment. Blood pressure was also measured onsite.
RESULTS: Nurses reported that 437 (26.5%) women were not eligible to use COCs,
compared with 485 (29.4%) according to self-report. Overall, 133 (8.1%) women who
said that they were eligible were deemed ineligible by nurses. The rate of
ineligibility was artificially high owing to participant and nurse assessments
that were incorrectly based on adverse effects of pill use and cultural reasons, 
and because of the sampling procedure, which intercepted women regardless of
their reasons for visiting the drug shop. Adjusted rates of ineligibility were
8.6% and 12.7%, respectively, according to nurse and participant assessment. Both
nurses and women underestimated the prevalence of hypertension in the present
group.
CONCLUSION: Self-screening among women in rural and peri-urban Tanzania with
regard to contraindications to COC use was comparable to assessment by trained
nurses.

Asynchronous food-web pathways could buffer the response of Serengeti predators
to El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation.

Understanding how entire ecosystems maintain stability in the face of climatic
and human disturbance is one of the most fundamental challenges in ecology.
Theory suggests that a crucial factor determining the degree of ecosystem
stability is simply the degree of synchrony with which different species in
ecological food webs respond to environmental stochasticity. Ecosystems in which 
all food-web pathways are affected similarly by external disturbance should
amplify variability in top carnivore abundance over time due to population
interactions, whereas ecosystems in which a large fraction of pathways are
nonresponsive or even inversely responsive to external disturbance will have more
constant levels of abundance at upper trophic levels. To test the mechanism
underlying this hypothesis, we used over half a century of demographic data for
multiple species in the Serengeti (Tanzania) ecosystem to measure the degree of
synchrony to variation imposed by an external environmental driver, the El NiÃ±o
Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO effects were mediated largely via changes in
dry-season vs. wet-season rainfall and consequent changes in vegetation
availability, propagating via bottom-up effects to higher levels of the Serengeti
food web to influence herbivores, predators and parasites. Some species in the
Serengeti food web responded to the influence of ENSO in opposite ways, whereas
other species were insensitive to variation in ENSO. Although far from
conclusive, our results suggest that a diffuse mixture of herbivore responses
could help buffer top carnivores, such as Serengeti lions, from variability in
climate. Future global climate changes that favor some pathways over others,
however, could alter the effectiveness of such processes in the future.

Rates of diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders within a prevalent
population of community-dwelling elderly people in sub-Saharan Africa.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of neurological disorders in those aged 70years and
over in the Hai district of Tanzania has been previously reported. The following 
research reports rates of patient's: treatment seeking, diagnosis and treatment
within this prevalent population.
METHODS: All people identified as having at least one neurological disorder in
the prevalence study were questioned regarding whether they had sought treatment 
for their disorder, whether they had had a previous correct diagnosis and whether
they were being currently treated.
RESULTS: From a background population of 2232 people, 349 people had neurological
disorders, of whom 225 (64.5%) had sought treatment for their symptoms. Of the
384 disorders identified in these 349 people, only 14.6% had been diagnosed and
only 9.9% were receiving appropriate treatment. Males were significantly more
likely to have been diagnosed and were more likely to have been treated
appropriately.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of diagnosis and treatment were low, with some gender
inequality. Reasons for this may include a lack of recognition of the condition
within the local population and lack of access to appropriate services. In the
absence of effective primary and secondary preventative measures, and effective
treatment, the burden of neurological disorders is likely to increase with
further demographic ageing.

A striking disparity exists across the globe, with essentially no large-scale
longitudinal studies ongoing in regions that will be significantly affected by
the oncoming non-communicable disease epidemic. The successful implementation of 
cohort studies in most low-resource research environments presents unique
challenges that may be aided by coordinated training programs. Leaders of
emerging cohort studies attending the First World Cohort Integration Workshop
were surveyed about training priorities, unmet needs and potential cross-cohort
solutions to these barriers through an electronic pre-workshop questionnaire and 
focus groups. Cohort studies representing India, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa,
Sweden, Tanzania and Uganda described similar training needs, including
on-the-job training, data analysis software instruction, and database and
bio-bank management. A lack of funding and protected time for training activities
were commonly identified constraints. Proposed solutions include a collaborative 
cross-cohort teaching platform with web-based content and interactive teaching
methods for a range of research personnel. An international network for research 
mentorship and idea exchange, and modifying the graduate thesis structure were
also identified as key initiatives. Cross-cohort integrated educational
initiatives will efficiently meet shared needs, catalyze the development of
emerging cohorts, speed closure of the global disparity in cohort research, and
may fortify scientific capacity development in low-resource settings.

BACKGROUND: The last decade has witnessed increased funding for malaria control. 
Malaria experts have used the opportunity to advocate for rollout of such
interventions as free bed nets. A free bed net distribution strategy is seen as
the quickest way to improve coverage of effective malaria control tools
especially among poorest communities. Evidence to support this claim is however, 
sparse. This study explored the effectiveness of targeted free bed net
distribution strategy in achieving equity in terms of ownership and use of bed
nets and also reduction of malaria prevalence among children under-five years of 
age.
METHODS: National malaria indicator survey (MIS) data from Angola, Tanzania and
Uganda was used in the analysis. Hierarchical multilevel logistic regression
models were used to analyse the relationship between variables of interest.
Outcome variables were defined as: childhood test-confirmed malaria infections,
household ownership of any mosquito net and children's use of any mosquito nets. 
Marginal effects of having free bed net distribution on households with different
wealth status were calculated.
RESULTS: Angolan children from wealthier households were 6.4 percentage points
less likely to be parasitaemic than those in poorest households, whereas those
from Tanzania and Uganda were less likely to test malaria positive by 7 and 11.6 
percentage points respectively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The study estimates and present
results on the marginal effects based on the impact of free bed net distribution 
on children's malaria status given their socio-economic background. Poorest
households were less likely to own a net by 21.4% in Tanzania, and 2.8% in
Uganda, whereas both poorer and wealthier Angolan households almost achieved
parity in bed net ownership (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Wealthier households had a higher margin
of using nets than poorest people in both Tanzania and Uganda by 11.4% and 3.9%
respectively. However, the poorest household in Angola had a 6.1% net use
advantage over children in wealthier households (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to use nationally representative data to
explore inequalities in bed net ownership and related consequences on childhood
malaria infection rates across different countries. While targeted distribution
of free bed nets improved overall bed net ownership, it did not overcome
ownership inequalities as measured by household socioeconomic status. Use of bed 
nets was disproportionately lower among poorest children, except for Angola where
bed net use was higher among poorest households when compared to children in
wealthier households. The study highlights the need for malaria control world
governing bodies and policy makers to continue working on finding appropriate
strategies to improve access to effective malaria control tools especially by the
poorest who often times bears the brunt of malaria burden than their wealthier
counterparts.

BACKGROUND: The African Health Initiative includes highly diverse partnerships in
five countries (Ghana, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia), each of which
is working to improve population health by strengthening health systems and to
evaluate the results. One aim of the Initiative is to generate cross-site
learning that can inform implementation in the five partnerships during the
project period and identify lessons that may be generalizable to other countries 
in the region. Collaborators in the Initiative developed a common evaluation
framework as a basis for this cross-site learning.
METHODS: This paper describes the components of the framework; this includes the 
conceptual model, core metrics to be measured in all sites, and standard
guidelines for reporting on the implementation of partnership activities and
contextual factors that may affect implementation, or the results it produces. We
also describe the systems that have been put in place for data management, data
quality assessments, and cross-site analysis of results.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual model for the Initiative highlights
points in the causal chain between health system strengthening activities and
health impact where evidence produced by the partnerships can contribute to
learning. This model represents an important advance over its predecessors by
including contextual factors and implementation strength as potential
determinants, and explicitly including equity as a component of both outcomes and
impact. Specific measurement challenges include the prospective documentation of 
program implementation and contextual factors. Methodological issues addressed in
the development of the framework include the aggregation of data collected using 
different methods and the challenge of evaluating a complex set of interventions 
being improved over time based on continuous monitoring and intermediate results.

BACKGROUND: Weak health information systems (HIS) are a critical challenge to
reaching the health-related Millennium Development Goals because health systems
performance cannot be adequately assessed or monitored where HIS data are
incomplete, inaccurate, or untimely. The Population Health Implementation and
Training (PHIT) Partnerships were established in five sub-Saharan African
countries (Ghana, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia) to catalyze advances 
in strengthening district health systems. Interventions were tailored to the
setting in which activities were planned.
COMPARISONS ACROSS STRATEGIES: All five PHIT Partnerships share a common feature 
in their goal of enhancing HIS and linking data with improved decision-making,
specific strategies varied. Mozambique, Ghana, and Tanzania all focus on
improving the quality and use of the existing Ministry of Health HIS, while the
Zambia and Rwanda partnerships have introduced new information and communication 
technology systems or tools. All partnerships have adopted a flexible, iterative 
approach in designing and refining the development of new tools and approaches
for HIS enhancement (such as routine data quality audits and automated
troubleshooting), as well as improving decision making through timely feedback on
health system performance (such as through summary data dashboards or routine
data review meetings). The most striking differences between partnership
approaches can be found in the level of emphasis of data collection (patient
versus health facility), and consequently the level of decision making
enhancement (community, facility, district, or provincial leadership).
DISCUSSION: Design differences across PHIT Partnerships reflect differing
theories of change, particularly regarding what information is needed, who will
use the information to affect change, and how this change is expected to
manifest. The iterative process of data use to monitor and assess the health
system has been heavily communication dependent, with challenges due to poor
feedback loops. Implementation to date has highlighted the importance of engaging
frontline staff and managers in improving data collection and its use for
informing system improvement. Through rigorous process and impact evaluation, the
experience of the PHIT teams hope to contribute to the evidence base in the areas
of HIS strengthening, linking HIS with decision making, and its impact on
measures of health system outputs and impact.

The Tanzania Connect Project: a cluster-randomized trial of the child survival
impact of adding paid community health workers to an existing facility-focused
health system.

BACKGROUND: Tanzania has been a pioneer in establishing community-level services,
yet challenges remain in sustaining these systems and ensuring adequate human
resource strategies. In particular, the added value of a cadre of professional
community health workers is under debate. While Tanzania has the highest density 
of primary health care facilities in Africa, equitable access and quality of care
remain a challenge. Utilization for many services proven to reduce child and
maternal mortality is unacceptably low. Tanzanian policy initiatives have sought 
to address these problems by proposing expansion of community-based providers,
but the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW ) lacks evidence that this
merits national implementation. The Tanzania Connect Project is a randomized
cluster trial located in three rural districts with a population of roughly
360,000 ( Kilombero, Rufiji, and Ulanga).
DESCRIPTION OF INTERVENTION: Connect aims to test whether introducing a community
health worker into a general program of health systems strengthening and referral
improvement will reduce child mortality, improve access to services, expand
utilization, and alter reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health seeking
behavior; thereby accelerating progress towards Millennium Development Goals 4
and 5. Connect has introduced a new cadre - Community Health Agents (CHA) - who
were recruited from and work in their communities. To support the CHA, Connect
developed supervisory systems, launched information and monitoring operations,
and implemented logistics support for integration with existing district and
village operations. In addition, Connect's district-wide emergency referral
strengthening intervention includes clinical and operational improvements.
EVALUATION DESIGN: Designed as a community-based cluster-randomized trial, CHA
were randomly assigned to 50 of the 101 villages within the Health and
Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the three study districts. To garner
detailed information on household characteristics, behaviors, and service
exposure, a random sub-sample survey of 3,300 women of reproductive age will be
conducted at the baseline and endline. The referral system intervention will use 
baseline, midline, and endline facility-based data to assess systemic changes.
Implementation and impact research of Connect will assess whether and how the
presence of the CHA at village level provides added life-saving value to the
health system.
DISCUSSION: Global commitment to launching community-based primary health care
has accelerated in recent years, with much of the implementation focused on
Africa. Despite extensive investment, no program has been guided by a truly
experimental study. Connect will not only address Tanzania's need for policy and 
operational research, it will bridge a critical international knowledge gap
concerning the added value of salaried professional community health workers in
the context of a high density of fixed facilities.Trial registration:

Strategic planning and appropriate development and management of water and
sanitation services are strongly supported by accurate and accessible data. If
adequately exploited, these data might assist water managers with performance
monitoring, benchmarking comparisons, policy progress evaluation, resources
allocation, and decision making. A variety of tools and techniques are in place
to collect such information. However, some methodological weaknesses arise when
developing an instrument for routine data collection, particularly at local
level: i) comparability problems due to heterogeneity of indicators, ii) poor
reliability of collected data, iii) inadequate combination of different
information sources, and iv) statistical validity of produced estimates when
disaggregated into small geographic subareas. This study proposes an improved
approach for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) data collection at
decentralised level in low income settings, as an attempt to overcome previous
shortcomings. The ultimate aim is to provide local policymakers with strong
evidences to inform their planning decisions. The survey design takes the Water
Point Mapping (WPM) as a starting point to record all available water sources at 
a particular location. This information is then linked to data produced by a
household survey. Different survey instruments are implemented to collect
reliable data by employing a variety of techniques, such as structured
questionnaires, direct observation and water quality testing. The collected data 
is finally validated through simple statistical analysis, which in turn produces 
valuable outputs that might feed into the decision-making process. In order to
demonstrate the applicability of the method, outcomes produced from three
different case studies (Homa Bay District-Kenya-; Kibondo District-Tanzania-; and
Municipality of Manhiça-Mozambique-) are presented.

Stakeholders' participation in planning and priority setting in the context of a 
decentralised health care system: the case of prevention of mother to child
transmission of HIV programme in Tanzania.

Shayo EH, Mboera LE, Blystad A.

7804, 5020 Bergen, Norway. bshayo@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: In Tanzania, decentralisation processes and reforms in the health
sector aimed at improving planning and accountability in the sector. As a result,
districts were given authority to undertake local planning and set priorities as 
well as allocate resources fairly to promote the health of a population with
varied needs. Nevertheless, priority setting in the health care service has
remained a challenge. The study assessed the priority setting processes in the
planning of the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)
programme at the district level in Tanzania.
METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted in Mbarali district, south-western 
Tanzania. The study applied in-depth interviews and focus group discussions in
the data collection. Informants included members of the Council Health Management
Team, regional PMTCT managers and health facility providers.
RESULTS: Two plans were reported where PMTCT activities could be accommodated;
the Comprehensive Council Health Plan and the Regional PMTCT Plan that was donor 
funded. As donors had their own globally defined priorities, it proved difficult 
for district and regional managers to accommodate locally defined PMTCT
priorities in these plans. As a result few of these were funded. Guidelines and
main priority areas of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) also
impacted on the ability of the districts and regions to act, undermining the
effectiveness of the decentralisation policy in the health sector.
CONCLUSION: The challenges in the priority setting processes revealed within the 
PMTCT initiative indicate substantial weaknesses in implementing the Tanzania
decentralisation policy. There is an urgent need to revive the strategies and
aims of the decentralisation policy at all levels of the health care system with 
a view to improving health service delivery.

Resurrection of New Caledonian maskray Neotrygon trigonoides (Myliobatoidei:
Dasyatidae) from synonymy with N. kuhlii, based on cytochrome-oxidase I gene
sequences and spotting patterns.

The maskray from New Caledonia, Neotrygon trigonoides Castelnau, 1873, has been
recently synonymized with the blue-spotted maskray, N. kuhlii (Müller and Henle, 
1841), a species with wide Indo-West Pacific distribution, but the reasons for
this are unclear. Blue-spotted maskray specimens were collected from the Indian
Ocean (Tanzania, Sumatra) and the Coral Triangle (Indonesia, Taiwan, and West
Papua), and N. trigonoides specimens were collected from New Caledonia
(Coral-Sea). Their partial COI gene sequences were generated to expand the
available DNA-barcode database on this species, which currently comprises
homologous sequences from Ningaloo Reef, the Coral Triangle and the Great Barrier
Reef (Coral-Sea). Spotting patterns were also compared across regions. Haplotypes
from the Coral-Sea formed a haplogroup phylogenetically distinct from all other
haplotypes sampled in the Indo-West Pacific. No clear-cut geographic composition 
relative to DNA-barcodes or spotting patterns was apparent in N. kuhlii samples
across the Indian Ocean and the Coral Triangle. The New Caledonian maskray had
spotting patterns markedly different from all the other samples. This, added to a
substantial level of net nucleotide divergence (2.6%) with typical N. kuhlii
justifies considering the New Caledonian maskray as a separate species, for which
we propose to resurrect the name Neotrygon trigonoides.

Epidemiology and interactions of Human Immunodeficiency Virus - 1 and Schistosoma
mansoni in sub-Saharan Africa.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1/AIDS and Schistosoma mansoni are widespread in
sub-Saharan Africa and co-infection occurs commonly. Since the early 1990s, it
has been suggested that the two infections may interact and potentiate the
effects of each other within co-infected human hosts. Indeed, S. mansoni
infection has been suggested to be a risk factor for HIV transmission and
progression in Africa. If so, it would follow that mass deworming could have
beneficial effects on HIV-1 transmission dynamics. The epidemiology of HIV in
African countries is changing, shifting from urban to rural areas where the
prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni is high and public health services are
deficient. On the other side, the consequent pathogenesis of HIV-1/S. mansoni
co-infection remains unknown. Here we give an account of the epidemiology of
HIV-1 and S. mansoni, discuss co-infection and possible biological causal
relationships between the two infections, and the potential impact of
praziquantel treatment on HIV-1 viral loads, CD4+ counts and CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Our
review of the available literature indicates that there is evidence to support
the hypothesis that S. mansoni infections can influence the replication of the
HIV-1, cell-to-cell transmission, as well as increase HIV progression as measured
by reduced CD4+ T lymphocytes counts. If so, then deworming of HIV positive
individuals living in endemic areas may impact on HIV-1 viral loads and CD4+ T
lymphocyte counts.

Reforms: a quest for efficiency or an opportunity for vested interests'? A case
study of pharmaceutical policy reforms in Tanzania.

Mori AT, Kaale EA, Risha P.

School of Pharmacy, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, P.O. Box 
65013, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. pax_amani@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Regulation of the pharmaceutical sector is a challenging task for
most governments in the developing countries. In Tanzania, this task falls under 
the Food and Drugs Authority and the Pharmacy Council. In 2010, the Pharmacy
Council spearheaded policy reforms in the pharmaceutical sector aimed at taking
over the control of the regulation of the business of pharmacy from the Tanzania 
Food and Drugs Authority. This study provides a critical analysis of these
reforms.
METHODS: The study employed a qualitative case-study design. Data was collected
through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and document reviews. Data
was analyzed thematically using a policy triangle framework. The analysis was
done manually.
RESULTS: The reforms adopted an incremental model of public policy-making and the
process was characterized by lobbying for political support, negotiations and
bargaining between the interest groups. These negotiations were largely centred
on vested interests and not on the impact of the reforms on the efficiency of
pharmaceutical regulations in the country. Stakeholders from the micro and meso
levels were minimally involved in the policy reforms.
CONCLUSION: Recent pharmaceutical regulation reforms in Tanzania were
overshadowed by vested interests, displacing a critical analysis of optimal
policy options that have the potential to increase efficiency in the regulation
of the business of pharmacy. Politics influenced decision-making at different
levels of the reform process.

BACKGROUND: Starting lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected
pregnant women may decrease HIV progression and transmission, but adherence after
delivery may be difficult, especially for asymptomatic women. We evaluated
disease progression among HIV-infected women not on ART with CD4 lymphocyte
counts above 200 cells per microliter at delivery.
METHODS: We analyzed risk of death, progression to AIDS (stage IV or CD4 < 200
cells per microliter), or to CD4 count <350 1 year after delivery among
postpartum women enrolled to a prevention of breastfeeding transmission trial
using the Kaplan-Meier method. In the primary analysis, women were censored if
ART was initiated.
RESULTS: Among 1285 women who were not WHO stage IV or less at 6 weeks
postpartum, 49 (4.3%) progressed to stage IV/CD4 <200 cells per microliter or
death by 1 year. Progression to CD4 <200 cells per microliter or death occurred
among 16 (4.3%) of 441 women with CD4 count of 350-549 cells per microliter and
10 (1.6%) of 713 with CD4 counts >550 cells per microliter at delivery. CD4 <350 
cells per microliter by 12 months postpartum occurred among 116 (37.0%) of 350
women with CD4 count 400-549 cells per microliter and 48 (7.4%) of 713 with CD4
count >550 cells per microliter at delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: Progression to AIDS or CD4 count <350 cells per microliter is
uncommon through 1 year postpartum for women with CD4 counts over 550 cells per
microliter at delivery, but occurred in over one third of those with CD4 counts
under 550 cells per microliter. ART should be continued after delivery or
breastfeeding among women with CD4 counts <550 cells per microliter if follow-up 
and antiretroviral adherence can be maintained.

Adverse drug events resulting from use of drugs with sulphonamide-containing
anti-malarials and artemisinin-based ingredients: findings on incidence and
household costs from three districts with routine demographic surveillance
systems in rural Tanzania.

E, Bloland PB, Abdulla SM, Kachur SP.

(Emory University), Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. jdnjau@emory.edu

BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial regimens containing sulphonamide or artemisinin
ingredients are widely used in malaria-endemic countries. However, evidence of
the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADR) to these drugs is limited,
especially in Africa, and there is a complete absence of information on the
economic burden such ADR place on patients. This study aimed to document ADR
incidence and associated household costs in three high malaria transmission
districts in rural Tanzania covered by demographic surveillance systems.
METHODS: Active and passive surveillance methods were used to identify ADR from
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and artemisinin (AS) use. ADR were identified by 
trained clinicians at health facilities (passive surveillance) and through
cross-sectional household surveys (active surveillance). Potential cases were
followed up at home, where a complete history and physical examination was
undertaken, and household cost data collected. Patients were classified as having
'possible' or 'probable' ADR by a physician.
RESULTS: A total of 95 suspected ADR were identified during a two-year period, of
which 79 were traced, and 67 reported use of SP and/or AS prior to ADR onset.
Thirty-four cases were classified as 'probable' and 33 as 'possible' ADRs. Most
(53) cases were associated with SP monotherapy, 13 with the AS/SP combination
(available in one of the two areas only), and one with AS monotherapy. Annual ADR
incidence per 100,000 exposures was estimated based on 'probable' ADR only at 5.6
for AS/SP in combination, and 25.0 and 11.6 for SP monotherapy. Median ADR
treatment costs per episode ranged from US$2.23 for those making a single
provider visit to US$146.93 for patients with four visits. Seventy-three per cent
of patients used out-of-pocket funds or sold part of their farm harvests to pay
for treatment, and 19% borrowed money.
CONCLUSION: Both passive and active surveillance methods proved feasible methods 
for anti-malarial ADR surveillance, with active surveillance being an important
complement to facility-based surveillance, given the widespread practice of
self-medication. Household costs associated with ADR treatment were high and
potentially catastrophic. Efforts should be made to both improve
pharmacovigilance across Africa and to identify strategies to reduce the economic
burden endured by households suffering from ADR.

Prevalence and correlates of common mental disorders among mothers of young
children in Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania.

Uriyo JG, Abubakar A, Swai M, Msuya SE, Stray-Pedersen B.

Division of Women and Children, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo,
Norway. j.g.uriyo@medisin.uio.no/

BACKGROUND: Although poor maternal mental health is a major public health
problem, with detrimental effects on the individual, her children and society,
information on its correlates in low-income countries is sparse.
AIMS: This study investigates the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMD)
among at-risk mothers, and explores its associations with sociodemographic
factors.
METHODS: This population-based survey of mothers of children aged 0-36 months
used the 14-item Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ). Mothers whose response was
"yes" to 8 or more items on the scale were defined as "at risk of CMD."
RESULTS: Of the 1,922 mothers (15-48 years), 28.8% were at risk of CMD. Risk of
CMD was associated with verbal abuse, physical abuse, a partner who did not help 
with the care of the child, being in a polygamous relationship, a partner with
low levels of education, and a partner who smoked cigarettes. Cohabiting appeared
to be protective.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate the significance of the quality
of relations with one's partner in shaping maternal mental health. The high
proportion of mothers who are at risk of CMD emphasizes the importance of
developing evidence-based mental health programmes as part of the care package
aimed at improving maternal well-being in Tanzania and other similar settings.

Furuncular myiasis of the foot caused by the tumbu fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga:
report in a medical student returning from a medical mission trip to Tanzania.

Palmieri JR, North D, Santo A.

Department of Microbiology, Infectious and Emerging Diseases-Edward Via College
of Osteopathic Medicine-Virginia Campus, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA.

Cutaneous myiasis in humans is a temporary parasitic infestation of the skin by
fly larvae or maggots of a variety of Dipteran families. In the United States,
autochthonous cases of myiasis are infrequently seen. Most cases of cutaneous
myiasis are acquired when traveling to tropical areas of Africa, Central America 
or South America. This case report involves a 26-year-old male medical student
who visited Tanzania on a medical mission trip. Three weeks following his return 
to the United States he developed a furuncular lesion on the side of the fifth
digit on his right foot, which contained the larva of the tumbu fly, Cordylobia
anthropophaga.

Comparison of three copromicroscopic methods to assess albendazole efficacy
against soil-transmitted helminth infections in school-aged children on Pemba
Island.

Musella V, Utzinger J, Ali SM, Ame SM, Cringoli G.

Department of Biology, University of Torino, 10122 Torino, Italy.

BACKGROUND: The diagnostic accuracy of three faecal egg count techniques
(Kato-Katz, McMaster and FLOTAC) to assess albendazole efficacy against
soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections was compared.
METHODS: The study is registered with Current Controlled Trials [identifier:
ISRCTN90088840]. During September-November 2009, 304 school-aged children on
Pemba Island, Tanzania, were screened and those infected with Ascaris
lumbricoides, hookworm or Trichuris trichiura were treated with a single dose of 
albendazole (400 mg). Twenty-one days post-treatment, children provided a single 
stool sample which was examined using the same diagnostic methods. All stool
samples were divided into two aliquots and one was fixed in 5% formalin and
examined using FLOTAC and McMaster approximately 6 months after collection.
RESULTS: Using fresh stool samples, comparable prevalences were demonstrated for 
the three methods at baseline (90-92.2% for T. trichiura, 41.1-52.8% for
hookworm, 32.9-37.2% for A. lumbricoides); FLOTAC was the most sensitive method
at baseline and follow-up. Albendazole showed high cure rate (CR) against
A. lumbricoides (90-97%), moderate CR against hookworm (63-72%) and very low CR
against T. trichiura (6-9%), regardless of the technique used. Egg counts (eggs
per gram) at baseline were similar for A. lumbricoides and for hookworm among the
three methods, and higher using McMaster and Kato-Katz compared with FLOTAC for
T. trichiura. All methods were similar for hookworm and A. lumbricoides egg
reduction rate (ERR) estimation, but Kato-Katz indicated a significantly higher
ERR than McMaster and FLOTAC for T. trichiura. Preserved stool samples revealed
consistently lower FECs at baseline and follow-up for all STHs.
CONCLUSION: Further development and validation of standard protocols for
anthelminthic drug efficacy evaluation must be pursued.

Chimpanzees detect ant-inhabited dead branches and stems: a study of the
utilization of plant-ant relationships in the Mahale Mountains, Tanzania.

Fuse M.

Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, miekofk@diamond.kobe-u.ac.jp.

Chimpanzees in the Mahale Mountains of Tanzania consume several species of stem- 
and branch-inhabiting ants throughout the year, without tools. Those ants are
cryptic species, and it was unknown how to find them constantly. There has been
little research on how the chimpanzees locate these ants. In this study, I use
behavioral observations of the chimpanzee predators and surveys of the ant fauna 
and plants across different habitats to test the hypothesis that chimpanzees use 
plant species as a cue to efficiently locate ant colonies in litter units (dead
parts of the plant). Ants were found to be associated with live plants and with
spaces within litter units which provide nesting places. Such ant-plant litter
relationships were not necessarily as strong as the mutualism often observed
between live plants and ants. The proportion of available litter units inhabited 
by ants was 20 %, and litter units of three plant species (Vernonia subligera,
Dracaena usambarensis, and Senna spectabilis) were well occupied by ants in the
home range of the chimpanzees. The ant-inhabited ratio in chimpanzee-foraged
litter units was higher than that in the available units in the home range.
Chimpanzees fed more often on Crematogaster spp. than on other resident ants and 
at a higher rate than expected from their occurrence in the litter units. Above
three plant species were well occupied by Crematogaster sp. 3 or C. sp. 18. It is
concluded that chimpanzees locate ants by selecting litter units of plant species
inhabited by ants.

Wild mushroom--an underutilized healthy food resource and income generator:
experience from Tanzania rural areas.

Tibuhwa DD.

Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology-MBB, University of Dar es
Salaam, PO Box 35179, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. dtibuhwa@yahoo.co.uk

BACKGROUND: This study documents the use of a wild edible mushroom (WEM) in
Tanzania rural areas and assesses its significance as a source of healthy food
and income for the disadvantaged rural dwellers.
METHODOLOGY: The data was gathered through local market surveys in order to
conventionally identify different common WEM taxa using a semi-structured
interview and it involved 160 people comprised of WEM hunters, traders and
consumers. The collected data covered the information on where, how, when and who
was the principal transmitter of the mycological knowledge learned and the
general information on their market and values.
RESULTS: Results show that mushroom gathering is gender oriented, dominated by
women (76.25%) whereas men account for 23.75%. Women possess vast knowledge of
mushroom folk taxonomy, biology and ecology and are therefore the principal
knowledge transmitters. It was also found that learning about WEM began at an
early age and is family tradition based. The knowledge is acquired and imparted
by practices and is mostly transmitted vertically through family dissemination.
The results also revealed that 75 WEM species belong to 14 families sold in fresh
or dry form. The common sold species belonged to the family Cantharellaceae (19) 
followed by Rusullaceae (16) and Lyophyllaceae (13), respectively. Collectors
residing near miombo woodland may harvest 20-30 buckets (capacity 20 liters) and 
the business may earn a person about $400-900 annually.
CONCLUSION: This finding envisages the purposeful strengthening of WEM
exploitation, which would contribute significantly in boosting the rural
income/economy and reduce conflicts between community and forest conservers. The 
activity would also provide alternative employment, improve food security to
rural disadvantaged groups especially women and old people hence improve their
livelihood.

BACKGROUND: Inter-individual variability in plasma concentration-time profiles
might contribute to differences in anti-malarial treatment response. This study
investigated the pharmacokinetics of three different forms of artemisinin
combination therapy (ACT) in Tanzania and Cambodia to quantify and identify
potential sources of variability.
METHODS: Drug concentrations were measured in 143 patients in Tanzania
(artemether, dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine and desbutyl-lumefantrine), and in 
63 (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin and mefloquine) and 60 (dihydroartemisinin and
piperaquine) patients in Cambodia. Inter- and intra-individual variabilities in
the pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed and the contribution of demographic 
and other covariates was quantified using a nonlinear mixed-effects modelling
approach (NONMEM®).
RESULTS: A one-compartment model with first-order absorption from the
gastrointestinal tract fitted the data for all drugs except piperaquine
(two-compartment). Inter-individual variability in concentration exposure was
about 40% and 12% for mefloquine. From all the covariates tested, only body
weight (for all antimalarials) and concomitant treatment (for artemether only)
showed a significant influence on these drugs' pharmacokinetic profiles.
Artesunate and dihydroartemisinin could not be studied in the Cambodian patients 
due to insufficient data-points. Modeled lumefantrine kinetics showed that the
target day 7 concentrations may not be achieved in a substantial proportion of
patients.
CONCLUSION: The marked variability in the disposition of different forms of ACT
remained largely unexplained by the available covariates. Dosing on body weight
appears justified. The concomitance of unregulated drug use (residual levels
found on admission) and sub-optimal exposure (variability) could generate low
plasma levels that contribute to selecting for drug-resistant parasites.

Comparison of medicine availability measurements at health facilities: evidence
from Service Provision Assessment surveys in five sub-Saharan African countries.

Choi Y, Ametepi P.

for International Development, 1201 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 200,

BACKGROUND: With growing emphasis on health systems strengthening in global
health, various health facility assessment methods have been used increasingly to
measure medicine and commodity availability. However, few studies have
systematically compared estimates of availability based on different definitions.
The objective of this study was to compare estimates of medicine availability
based on different definitions.
METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted using data from the Service
Provision Assessment (SPA)--a nationally representative sample survey of health
facilities--conducted in five countries: Kenya SPA 2010, Namibia SPA 2009, Rwanda
SPA 2007, Tanzania SPA 2006, and Uganda SPA 2007. For 32 medicines, percent of
facilities having the medicine were estimated using five definitions: four for
current availability and one for six-month period availability. 'Observed
availability of at least one valid unit' was used as a reference definition, and 
ratios between the reference and each of the other four estimates were
calculated. Summary statistics of the ratios among the 32 medicines were
calculated by country. The ratios were compared further between public and
non-public facilities within each country.
RESULTS: Across five countries, compared to current observed availability of at
least one valid unit, 'reported availability without observation' was on average 
6% higher (ranging from 3% in Rwanda to 8% in Namibia), 'observed availability
where all units were valid' was 11% lower (ranging from 2% in Tanzania to 19% in 
Uganda), and 'six-month period availability' was 14% lower (ranging from 5% in
Namibia to 25% in Uganda).
CONCLUSIONS: Medicine availability estimates vary substantially across
definitions, and need to be interpreted with careful consideration of the methods
used.

Effect of concentrate supplementation levels on growth and slaughter
characteristics of SEA and SEA Ã— Norwegian goats under on-farm conditions.

Hozza WA, Kifaro GC, Safari JG, Mushi DE.

Department of Animal Science and Production, Sokoine University of Agriculture,
P.O. Box 3004, Morogoro, Tanzania, hozzaw@yahoo.com.

A 2â€‰Ã—â€‰3 factorial experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of goat
genotypes and different concentrate levels on growth and slaughter
characteristics of Small East African Ã— Norwegian crossbred (SEA Ã— N) and Small
East African (SEA) goats. The three concentrate levels were T0 (no access to
concentrate), T66 (66Â % access to ad libitum concentrate allowance) and T100
(100Â % access to ad libitum concentrate allowance). Twenty-four castrated goats
of each genotype (18Â months old with an average weight of 16.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.54Â kg) were
randomly allotted into T0, T66 and T100 treatments. Daily feed intake and
fortnight body weight measurements were recorded for the whole 84-day
experimental period, after which the animals were slaughtered. Feed intake of
T100 animals was 536Â g/day, which was 183Â g/day higher than that of the T66
group. Supplemented goats (T66 and T100) had significantly (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) higher
daily gain and body condition score, and better feed conversion efficiency and
dressing percentage than T0 goats. The SEA goats had higher (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) hot
carcass weight (8.2 vs. 7.9Â kg) and showed better (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) dressing percentage 
than SEA Ã— N animals. Among supplemented goats, the cost of a 1-kg gain under T66
was Tshs 213/= cheaper than T100 (US$1â€‰â‰ˆâ€‰Tshs 1,500). It is concluded that goats 
should be grazed and supplemented with 353 g concentrate/day for satisfactory
fattening performance and higher economic return on investment.

Parents' experiences of reporting child sexual abuse in urban Tanzania.

Kisanga F, NystrÃ¶m L, Hogan N, Emmelin M.

Community Medicine Department, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied
Sciences, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. kisangaf@yahoo.co.uk

This article reports parental experiences of legally reporting child sexual abuse
in Tanzania. Based on in-depth interviews, four types of sexual abuse incidents
are portrayed. Each evokes different reactions from parents and the community. An
incident characterized as the innocent child was associated with a determination 
to seek justice. The forced-sex youth elicited feelings of parental betrayal of
their child. The consenting curious youth resulted in uncertainty of how to
proceed, while the transactional-sex youth evoked a sense of parental
powerlessness to control the child because of low economic status.
Differentiating between types of sexual abuse incidents may increase awareness of
the complexities of child sexual abuse reporting. Education on laws regulating
sexual offenses and a functional national child protection system are needed to
address child sexual abuse complexities and safeguard the rights of children in
Tanzania.

We describe the frequency of and factors associated with disclosure, knowledge of
partner's HIV status, and consistent condom use among 3538 HIV-positive patients 
attending eighteen HIV care and treatment clinics in Kenya, Namibia, and
Tanzania. Overall, 42% of patients were male, and 64% were on antiretroviral
treatment. The majority (80%) had disclosed their HIV status to their partners,
64% knew their partner's HIV status, and 77% reported consistent condom use. Of
those who knew their partner's status, 18% reported their partner was HIV
negative. Compared to men, women were significantly less likely to report
disclosing their HIV status to their sex partner(s), to knowing their partner's
HIV status, and to using condoms consistently with HIV-negative partners. Other
factors negatively associated with consistent condom use include nondisclosure,
alcohol use, reporting a casual sex partner, and desiring a pregnancy. Health
care providers should target additional risk reduction counseling and support
services to patients who report these characteristics.

'â€¦ in the project they really care for us': meaning and experiences of
participating in a clinical study of first-line treatment for malaria and HIV in 
Tanzanian adults.

Medicine, London, UK. Joanna.Reynolds@lshtm.ac.uk

Critiques of biomedical research in low-resource settings typically centre on
clinical trials and the 'dissymmetries of power' between the researched and those
benefiting from the products of research. It is important to extend this critical
lens to other forms of global health research. We conducted a qualitative study
in Tanzania to explore meaning and experiences of participating in a clinical
observational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of current practice for
treating HIV and malaria co-infection. Focus group discussions and in-depth
interviews were undertaken with 124 study participants, study staff and health
workers. Participants' understanding of the study's research aims was limited,
but the practice of participation - engaging with research staff and materials - 
appeared to facilitate interpretations of the study's value, conceptualised as a 
'service'. For those peripheral to the study, however, interpretations of it
reflected existing suspicions of experimental research. Our findings indicate the
importance of considering the expectations, roles and responsibilities
constructed through the practice of participation in different types of research,
and how they relate to legacies of research. Understanding how networks of
research practice intersect local social and historical contexts can extend
discussions of collaboration and engagement with research in low-resource
settings.

Maternal near miss and mortality in a rural referral hospital in northern
Tanzania: a cross-sectional study.

Nelissen EJ, Mduma E, Ersdal HL, Evjen-Olsen B, van Roosmalen JJ, Stekelenburg J.

Haydom Lutheran Hospital, 9000 Haydom, Manyara, Tanzania. ejtnelissen@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: Maternal morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa remains high
despite global efforts to reduce it. In order to lower maternal morbidity and
mortality in the immediate term, reduction of delay in the provision of quality
obstetric care is of prime importance. The aim of this study is to assess the
occurrence of severe maternal morbidity and mortality in a rural referral
hospital in Tanzania as proposed by the WHO near miss approach and to assess
implementation levels of key evidence-based interventions in women experiencing
severe maternal morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was performed from November 2009
until November 2011 in a rural referral hospital in Tanzania. All maternal near
misses and maternal deaths were included. As not all WHO near miss criteria were 
applicable, a modification was used to identify cases. Data were collected from
medical records using a structured data abstraction form. Descriptive frequencies
were calculated for demographic and clinical variables, outcome indicators,
underlying causes, and process indicators.
RESULTS: In the two-year period there were 216 maternal near misses and 32
maternal deaths. The hospital-based maternal mortality ratio was 350 maternal
deaths per 100,000 live births (95% CI 243-488). The maternal near miss incidence
ratio was 23.6 per 1,000 live births, with an overall case fatality rate of
12.9%. Oxytocin for prevention of postpartum haemorrhage was used in 96 of 201
women and oxytocin for treatment of postpartum haemorrhage was used in 38 of 66
women. Furthermore, eclampsia was treated with magnesium sulphate in 87% of all
cases. Seventy-four women underwent caesarean section, of which 25 women did not 
receive prophylactic antibiotics. Twenty-eight of 30 women who were admitted with
sepsis received parenteral antibiotics. The majority of the cases with uterine
rupture (62%) occurred in the hospital.
CONCLUSION: Maternal morbidity and mortality remain challenging problems in a
rural referral hospital in Tanzania. Key evidence-based interventions are not
implemented in women with severe maternal morbidity and mortality. Progress can
be made through up scaling the use of evidence-based interventions, such as the
use of oxytocin for prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage.

Sister Mary Joseph's nodule at a University teaching hospital in northwestern
Tanzania: a retrospective review of 34 cases.

Chalya PL, Mabula JB, Rambau PF, McHembe MD.

Department of Surgery, Catholic University of Health and Allied Sciences-Bugando,
Mwanza, Tanzania. drphillipoleo@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Sister Mary Joseph's nodule is a metastatic tumor deposit in the
umbilicus and often represents advanced intra-abdominal malignancy with dismal
prognosis. There is a paucity of published data on this subject in our setting.
This study was conducted to describe the clinicopathological presentation and
treatment outcome of this condition in our environment and highlight challenges
associated with the care of these patients, and to proffer solutions for improved
outcome.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of histologically confirmed cases of
Sister Mary Joseph's nodule seen at Bugando Medical Centre between March 2003 and
February 2013. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were enrolled in the study. Males outnumbered
females by a ratio of 1.4:1. The vast majority of patients (70.6%) presented with
large umbilical nodule > 2 cm in size. The stomach (41.1%) was the most common
location of the primary tumor. Adenocarcinoma (88.2%) was the most frequent
histopathological type. Most of the primary tumors (52.9%) were poorly
differentiated. As the disease was advanced and metastatic in all patients, only 
palliative therapy was offered. Out of 34 patients, 11 patients died in the
hospital giving a mortality rate of 32.4%. Patients were followed up for 24
months. At the end of the follow-up period, 14(60.9%) patients were lost to
follow-up and the remaining 9 (39.1%) patients died. Patients survived for a
median period of 28 weeks (range, 2 to 64 weeks). The nodule recurred in 6
(26.1%) patients after complete excision.
CONCLUSION: Sister Mary Joseph's nodule of the umbilicus is not rare in our
environment and often represents manifestation of a variety of advanced
intra-abdominal malignancies. The majority of the patients present at a late
stage and many with distant metastases. The patient's survival is very short
leading to a poor outcome. Early detection of primary cancer at an early stage
may improve the prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Current estimates suggest an HIV prevalence of 42% among people who
inject drugs (PWIDs) in Dar es Salaam, while HIV prevalence is estimated to be
8.8% among the general population in the city. To address the HIV epidemic in
this population, the government of Tanzania began establishing HIV prevention,
treatment and care services including outreach and medication assisted treatment 
(MAT) for PWIDs in 2010. We assessed gender inequities in utilization of outreach
and MAT services and evaluated differences in HIV risk behaviors between female
and male PWIDs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routine outreach data between December 2010 to mid-August 
2012 and baseline data on clients enrolling in methadone from February 2011 to
August 2012 were utilized. Binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted
relative risk estimates comparing females to males.
RESULTS: From December 2010 to August 2012, 8,578 contacts were made to drug
users; among them 1,898 were injectors. A total of 453 injectors were eligible
and referred to MAT, of which, 443 enrolled in treatment. However, regarding
total outreach contacts, outreach to PWID, referral to MAT and enrollment in MAT,
8% or less of drug users accessing services were women. In contrast, weighted
estimations from surveys suggest that 34% of PWIDs are female, and this
approximation is similar to recent population size estimations. Overall, 43% of
traditional outreach workers conducting outreach with drug users were female.
Though reporting higher levels of condom usage, female PWID were more likely to
report multiple sex partners, anal sex, commercial sex work and struggle under a 
higher burden of addiction, mental disorders and abuse.
CONCLUSIONS: Services have not been mobilized adequately to address the clear
needs of females who inject drugs. A clear and urgent need exists for
women-centered strategies that effectively engage female PWID into HIV prevention
services.

An Epidemiologic Investigation of Potential Risk Factors for Nodding Syndrome in 
Kitgum District, Uganda.

and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.

INTRODUCTION: Nodding Syndrome (NS), an unexplained illness characterized by
spells of head bobbing, has been reported in Sudan and Tanzania, perhaps as early
as 1962. Hypothesized causes include sorghum consumption, measles, and
onchocerciasis infection. In 2009, a couple thousand cases were reportedly in
Northern Uganda.
METHODS: In December 2009, we identified cases in Kitgum District. The case
definition included persons who were previously developmentally normal who had
nodding. Cases, further defined as 5- to 15-years-old with an additional
neurological deficit, were matched to village controls to assess risk factors and
test biological specimens. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate
associations.
RESULTS: Surveillance identified 224 cases; most (95%) were 5-15-years-old
(rangeâ€Š=â€Š2-27). Cases were reported in Uganda since 1997. The overall prevalence 
was 12 cases per 1,000 (range by parishâ€Š=â€Š0Â·6-46). The case-control investigation
(nâ€Š=â€Š49 case/village control pairs) showed no association between NS and
previously reported measles; sorghum was consumed by most subjects. Positive
onchocerciasis serology [age-adjusted odds ratio (AOR1)â€Š=â€Š14Â·4 (2Â·7, 78Â·3)],
exposure to munitions [AOR1â€Š=â€Š13Â·9 (1Â·4, 135Â·3)], and consumption of crushed
roots [AOR1â€Š=â€Š5Â·4 (1Â·3, 22Â·1)] were more likely in cases. Vitamin B6 deficiency
was present in the majority of cases (84%) and controls (75%).
CONCLUSION: NS appears to be increasing in Uganda since 2000 with 2009 parish
prevalence as high as 46 cases per 1,000 5- to 15-year old children. Our results 
found no supporting evidence for many proposed NS risk factors, revealed
association with onchocerciasis, which for the first time was examined with
serologic testing, and raised nutritional deficiencies and toxic exposures as
possible etiologies.

Challenges in diagnosing paediatric malaria in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Strøm GE, Haanshuus CG, Fataki M, Langeland N, Blomberg B.

Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.
gro_strom@hotmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality. As no
clinical features clearly differentiate malaria from other febrile illnesses, and
malaria diagnosis is challenged by often lacking laboratory equipment and
expertise, overdiagnosis and overtreatment is common.
METHODS: Children admitted with fever at the general paediatric wards at
Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from January to June
2009 were recruited consecutively and prospectively. Demographic and clinical
features were registered. Routine thick blood smear microscopy at MNH was
compared to results of subsequent thin blood smear microscopy, and rapid
diagnostics tests (RDTs). Genus-specific PCR of Plasmodium mitochondrial DNA was 
performed on DNA extracted from whole blood and species-specific PCR was done on 
positive samples.
RESULTS: Among 304 included children, 62.6% had received anti-malarials during
the last four weeks prior to admission and 65.1% during the hospital stay.
Routine thick blood smears, research blood smears, PCR and RDT detected malaria
in 13.2%, 6.6%, 25.0% and 13.5%, respectively. Positive routine microscopy was
confirmed in only 43% (17/40), 45% (18/40) and 53% (21/40), by research
microscopy, RDTs and PCR, respectively. Eighteen percent (56/304) had positive
PCR but negative research microscopy. Reported low parasitaemia on routine
microscopy was associated with negative research blood slide and PCR.
RDT-positive cases were associated with signs of severe malaria. Palmar pallor,
low haemoglobin and low platelet count were significantly associated with
positive PCR, research microscopy and RDT.
CONCLUSIONS: The true morbidity attributable to malaria in the study population
remains uncertain due to the discrepancies in results among the diagnostic
methods. The current routine microscopy appears to result in overdiagnosis of
malaria and, consequently, overuse of anti-malarials. Conversely, children with a
false positive malaria diagnosis may die because they do not receive treatment
for the true cause of their illness. RDTs appear to have the potential to improve
routine diagnostics, but the clinical implication of the many RDT-negative,
PCR-positive samples needs to be elucidated.

What makes wild chimpanzees wake up at night?

Zamma K.

Great Ape Research Institute, Hayashibara, 952-2 Nu, Tamano, Okayama, 706-0316,
Japan, zamma@jambo.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp.

I examined the possible cause of night awakening among wild chimpanzees (Pan
troglodytes) in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Chimpanzee
vocalizations and activity-related sounds (CVSs) were used to indicate awakening 
because I was unable to visually observe them. Over a 5-night observation period,
CVSs (n = 128) were heard every night, and most (n = 91) were observed within
5 min of previous CVSs. Chimpanzees use CVSs as social communication to maintain 
spatial contact with other chimpanzees who occasionally travel at night. The
first sound in a sequence of CVSs (CVS bout) was heard immediately following the 
vocalization or sound of another animal (n = 11), defecation or urination by a
chimpanzee (n = 7), or unknown (n = 19). CVS bouts were longer when preceded by
defecation or urination than when preceded by the vocalization or sound of other 
animals or an unknown factor. This suggests that the degree of wakefulness varies
according to the possible cause of the disturbance. CVSs at night may be provoked
by various factors, and awakening during the night is probably common among
diurnal primates.

Blood glucose as a predictor of mortality in children admitted to the hospital
with febrile illness in Tanzania.

bnadjm@yahoo.com

Data from a prospective study of 3,319 children ages 2 months to 5 years admitted
with febrile illness to a Tanzanian district hospital were analyzed to determine 
the relationship of blood glucose and mortality. Hypoglycemia (blood sugar < 2.5 
mmol/L and < 45 mg/dL) was found in 105 of 3,319 (3.2%) children at admission,
and low-normal blood glucose (2.5-5 mmol/L and 45-90 mg/dL) was found in 773 of
3,319 (23.3%) children. Mortality was inversely related to admission blood sugar;
compared with children with an admission blood glucose of > 5 mmol/L, the
adjusted odds of dying were 3.3 (95% confidence interval = 2.1-5.2) and 9.8 (95% 
confidence interval = 5.1-19.0) among children with admission blood glucose 2.5-5
and < 2.5 mmol/L, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 
suggested an optimal cutoff for admission blood sugar of < 5 mmol/L in predicting
mortality (sensitivity = 57.7%, specificity = 75.2%). A cutoff for admission
blood glucose of < 5 mmol/L represents a simple and clinically useful predictor
of mortality in children admitted with severe febrile illness to hospital in
resource-poor settings.

BACKGROUND: At the local level, malaria transmission clusters in hotspots, which 
may be a group of households that experience higher than average exposure to
infectious mosquitoes. Active case detection often relying on rapid diagnostic
tests for mass screen and treat campaigns has been proposed as a method to detect
and treat individuals in hotspots. Data from a cross-sectional survey conducted
in north-western Tanzania were used to examine the spatial distribution of
Plasmodium falciparum and the relationship between household exposure and
parasite density.
METHODS: Dried blood spots were collected from consenting individuals from four
villages during a survey conducted in 2010. These were analysed by PCR for the
presence of P. falciparum, with the parasite density of positive samples being
estimated by quantitative PCR. Household exposure was estimated using the
distance-weighted PCR prevalence of infection. Parasite density simulations were 
used to estimate the proportion of infections that would be treated using a
screen and treat approach with rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) compared to targeted 
mass drug administration (tMDA) and Mass Drug Administration (MDA).
RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction PCR analysis revealed that of the 3,057 blood 
samples analysed, 1,078 were positive. Mean distance-weighted PCR prevalence per 
household was 34.5%. Parasite density was negatively associated with transmission
intensity with the odds of an infection being subpatent increasing with household
exposure (OR 1.09 per 1% increase in exposure). Parasite density was also related
to age, being highest in children five to ten years old and lowest in those >â€‰40 
years. Simulations of different tMDA strategies showed that treating all
individuals in households where RDT prevalence was above 20% increased the number
of infections that would have been treated from 43 to 55%. However, even with
this strategy, 45% of infections remained untreated.
CONCLUSION: The negative relationship between household exposure and parasite
density suggests that DNA-based detection of parasites is needed to provide
adequate sensitivity in hotspots. Targeting MDA only to households with
RDT-positive individuals may allow a larger fraction of infections to be treated.
These results suggest that community-wide MDA, instead of screen and treat
strategies, may be needed to successfully treat the asymptomatic, subpatent
parasite reservoir and reduce transmission in similar settings.

The double burden.

Faurholt-Jepsen D.

Department of Human Nutrition, University of Copenhagen, Rolighedsvej 30, 1958
Frederiksberg C, Denmark. daniel@faurholt-jepsen.dk

One third of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and with the lifestyle changes succeeding the on-going
urbanization, populations already burdened by tuberculosis are experiencing a
dramatic increase in chronic diseases, with diabetes being a serious challenge.
Tuberculosis and diabetes are not only becoming co-existing diseases. In fact,
the diseases interact, and there is evidence to suggest that especially diabetes 
disease increases the susceptibility for developing active tuberculosis disease. 
Furthermore, it is plausible that tuberculosis leads to, either transient or
permanent, impairment of the glucose metabolism, which ultimately will turn into 
diabetes. A number of studies from the Americas, Europe, Asia, and, most lately, 
from sub-Saharan Africa have reported strong association between tuberculosis and
diabetes; on average, the estimated risk of active tuberculosis is thrice as high
among people with diabetes. The study from sub-Saharan Africa was conducted in
Tanzania and is the basis of this thesis. Based on available evidence on the
association between tuberculosis and diabetes, the primary aim of the study was
to assess the role of diabetes for tuberculosis risk, manifestations, treatment
outcomes and survival in a Tanzanian population of tuberculosis patients and
non-tuberculosis neighbourhood controls. The study was conducted in Mwanza City
in northern Tanzania, with a population exceeding half a million inhabitants,
with tuberculosis and HIV being common infections in the region, but with little 
knowledge about the prevalence of diabetes. We recruited newly diagnosed
pulmonary tuberculosis patients from spring 2006 and continuously till the fall
2009, with all participating in a nutritional intervention running in parallel
with the medical tuberculosis treatment. All participants underwent diabetes and 
HIV testing as well as a series of measurements such as anthropometric, clinical 
and paraclinical parameters. The population was followed up during treatment (2
and 5 months) to assess treatment outcome as well as after one year to assess
their survival status. Based on data from 1,250 tuberculosis patients and 350
neighbourhood controls, we found that 38 and 21%, respectively, had impaired
glycaemia, and that the prevalence of diabetes was 17 and 9% among tuberculosis
patients and controls, respectively. This difference in prevalence between
patients and controls was equivalent to an adjusted odds ratio of more than four,
indicating a strong association between tuberculosis and diabetes. Furthermore,
we found that diabetes was associated with tuberculosis among both participants
with or without HIV co-infection. Despite the strong association, diabetes had
only moderate clinical implications when the tuberculosis patients initiated the 
tuberculosis treatment; the patients with diabetes co-morbidity had a minor
elevation in the immune response and more frequently reported to have fever.
Furthermore, diabetes did not seem to delay time to sputum conversion during
treatment. Nevertheless, diabetes co-morbidity led to impaired treatment outcome 
with slower recovery of weight and haemoglobin and a more than four times higher 
mortality rate within the initial phase of tuberculosis treatment. In conclusion,
in the African region, the double burden of tuberculosis and diabetes is becoming
a major health problem. Although the tuberculosis incidence has stabilized during
the last decade, the increasing incidence of diabetes will possibly interfere
with tuberculosis control and may, consequently, make the tuberculosis incidence 
increase again. Future research strategies should focus on enhanced diagnostic
tools to identify tuberculosis patients with diabetes co-morbidity, and on the
role of disease-disease, drug-disease and drug-drug interactions between
tuberculosis and diabetes diseases and treatments.

INTRODUCTION: Severe acute malnutrition is common in developing countries.
Children with severe acute malnutrition are prone to complications, including
electrolyte imbalance and infections. Our patient was an 18-month-old boy who had
severe acute malnutrition (kwashiorkor) and developed acute kidney injury, which 
was managed with peritoneal dialysis using improvised equipment. This case report
illustrates the importance of improvisation in resource-limited settings in
providing lifesaving treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
case report on peritoneal dialysis in a child with severe acute malnutrition
(kwashiorkor).
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an 18-month-old Bantu-African Tanzanian
boy who had severe malnutrition and developed anuric acute kidney injury. He had 
severe renal dysfunction and was managed with peritoneal dialysis using an
improvised catheter and bedside constituted fluids (from intravenous fluids) and 
was diuretic after 7 days of peritoneal dialysis, with complete recovery of renal
functions after 2 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Children with severe acute malnutrition who develop acute kidney
injury should be offered peritoneal dialysis, which may be provided using
improvised equipment in resource-limited settings, as illustrated in this case
report.

AIM: To describe chest radiographic abnormalities and assess their usefulness for
predicting causes of fever in a resource-limited setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Febrile patients were enrolled in Moshi, Tanzania, and
chest radiographs were evaluated by radiologists in Tanzania and the United
States. Radiologists were blinded to the results of extensive laboratory
evaluations to determine the cause of fever.
RESULTS: Of 870 febrile patients, 515 (59.2%) had a chest radiograph available;
including 268 (66.5%) of the adolescents and adults, the remainder were infants
and children. One hundred and nineteen (44.4%) adults and 51 (20.6%) children
were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected. Among adults, radiographic
abnormalities were present in 139 (51.9%), including 77 (28.7%) with homogeneous 
and heterogeneous lung opacities, 26 (9.7%) with lung nodules, 25 (9.3%) with
pleural effusion, 23 (8.6%) with cardiomegaly, and 13 (4.9%) with
lymphadenopathy. Among children, radiographic abnormalities were present in 87
(35.2%), including 76 (30.8%) with homogeneous and heterogeneous lung opacities
and six (2.4%) with lymphadenopathy. Among adolescents and adults, the presence
of opacities was predictive of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Coxiella burnetii,
whereas the presence of pulmonary nodules was predictive of Histoplasma
capsulatum and Cryptococcus neoformans.
CONCLUSIONS: Chest radiograph abnormalities among febrile inpatients are common
in northern Tanzania. Chest radiography is a useful adjunct for establishing an
aetiologic diagnosis of febrile illness and may provide useful information for
patient management, in particular for pneumococcal disease, Q fever, and fungal
infections.

Comment in
    J Travel Med. 2013 Jul-Aug;20(4):211-3.

Schistosoma haematobium infection is mainly associated with urinary
schistosomiasis. Here, we describe two cases of S haematobium infection in
workers returning to China from Tanzania and Angola. They had hematuria and were 
misdiagnosed as having tuberculosis or tumor of the bladder. The diagnosis was
established by discovery of eggs in the urine.

Tanzania is an equatorial country characterized by warm temperatures, which
should increase the volatilization of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), but
this scenario could be different in mountainous areas like Mount Meru, a volcano 
situated in the East African Rift (Tz). We collected soil samples along an
altitudinal transect upto 4577 m a.s.l., reporting the first data about POP
contamination in this area (DDX, HCHs, HCB and PCBs). The DDX contamination
pattern in Mt. Meru shows levels slightly higher than those of other remote
places with a strong increase in the metabolites/DDT historical trend, which is
different from DDX, PCBs, HCHs and particularly HCB as this shows very low
contamination levels. Back trajectory analysis allowed a discussion about
putative contamination sources, while analysis of the environmental features
(climatic and pedological) allowed us to discriminate their relative importance. 
The distribution of POPs shows a strong correlation with soil organic matter and 
vegetation. SOM-normalization evidenced altitudinal dependence according to cold 
condensation for PCBs and HCHs, while DDX are present in larger amounts in the
agricultural area at the volcano foot. OM-normalized concentrations suggested
also a possible role of the OM composition on the POPs' distribution.

Intimate Partner Violence and Breastfeeding in Africa.

Misch ES, Yount KM.

University, 1518 Clifton Rd, NE, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA, emisch@gmail.com.

We examined the associations of maternal intimate partner violence (IPV)
victimization with early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding in eight African 
countries. For mothers 15-49Â years with an infant aged less than 6Â months from
national Demographic and Health Surveys since 2007 for Ghana (nÂ =Â 173), Kenya
(nÂ =Â 449), Liberia (nÂ =Â 313), Malawi (nÂ =Â 397), Nigeria (nÂ =Â 2007), Tanzania
(nÂ =Â 549), Zambia (nÂ =Â 454), and Zimbabwe (nÂ =Â 480), logistic regression was used
to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted associations of lifetime maternal
emotional, physical, and sexual IPV victimization with early initiation (less
than 1Â hour of birth) and exclusive breastfeeding in the prior 24Â hours. Maternal
lifetime IPV victimization often was adversely associated with optimal
breastfeeding practices. Physical IPV in Zimbabwe (aOR 0.40, pÂ =Â 0.002), sexual
IPV in Zambia (aOR 0.42, pÂ =Â 0.017), and emotional IPV in Kenya (aOR 0.54,
pÂ =Â 0.050) and Tanzania (aOR 0.57, pÂ =Â 0.088) were associated with lower adjusted
odds of early initiation. Sexual IPV in Liberia (aOR 0.09, pÂ =Â 0.026), Ghana (aOR
0.17, pÂ =Â 0.033), and Kenya (aOR 0.34, pÂ =Â 0.085) were associated with lower
adjusted odds of exclusive breastfeeding. Atypically, physical IPV in Tanzania
(aOR 2.11, pÂ =Â 0.042) and sexual IPV in Zambia (aOR 2.49, pÂ =Â 0.025) were
associated with higher adjusted odds of early initiation and exclusive
breastfeeding, respectively. Across several settings, maternal IPV victimization 
may adversely influence breastfeeding practices. Longitudinal research of these
relationships is warranted. Screening for IPV victimization and breastfeeding
counseling in prenatal and postpartum care may mitigate the potential
intergenerational effects of IPV.

1-infected cohort in rural Tanzania.

The development of resistance mutations in drug-targeted HIV-1 genes compromises 
the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs. Genotyping of these
mutations enables adjusted therapeutic decisions both at the individual and
population level. We investigated over time the prevalence of HIV-1 primary drug 
resistance mutations in treatment-naive patients and described the HIV-1 subtype 
distribution in a cohort in rural Tanzania at the beginning of the ART rollout in
2005-2007 and later in 2009. Viral RNA was analyzed in 387 baseline plasma
samples from treatment-naive patients over a period of 5 years. The reverse
transcriptase (RT) and protease genes were reversely transcribed, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplified, and directly sequenced to identify HIV-1 subtypes
and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with drug resistance (DR-SNPs).
The prevalence of major DR-SNPs in 2005-2007 in the RT gene was determined: K103N
(5.0%), Y181C (2.5%), M184V (2.5%), and G190A (1.7%), and M41L, K65KR, K70KR, and
L74LV (0.8%). In samples from 2009 only K103N (3.3%), M184V, and T215FY (0.8%)
were detected. Initial frequencies of subtypes C, A, D, and recombinants were
43%, 32%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. Later similar frequencies were found except 
for the recombinants, which were found twice as often (15%), highlighting the
subtype diversity and a relatively stable subtype frequency in the area. DR-SNPs 
were found at initiation of the cohort despite very low previous ART use in the
area. Statistically, frequencies of major mutations did not change significantly 
over the studied 5-year interval. These mutations could reflect primary
resistances and may indicate a possible risk for treatment failure.

BACKGROUND: Young people are at high risk of HIV and developing appropriate
prevention programmes requires an understanding of the risk factors for HIV in
this age group. We investigated factors associated with HIV among participants
aged 15-30 years in a 2007-8 cross-sectional survey nested within a
community-randomised trial of the MEMA kwa Vijana intervention in 20 rural
communities in northwest Tanzania.
METHODS: We analysed data for 7259(53%) males and 6476(47%) females. Using a
proximate-determinant conceptual framework and conditional logistic regression,
we obtained sex-specific Odds Ratios (ORs) for the association of HIV infection
with socio-demographic, knowledge, behavioural and biological factors.
RESULTS: HSV-2 infection was strongly associated with HIV infection (females:
adjOR 4.4, 95%CI 3.2-6.1; males: adjOR 4.2, 95%CI 2.8-6.2). Several
socio-demographic factors (such as age, marital status and mobility), behavioural
factors (condom use, number and type of sexual partnerships) and biological
factors (blood transfusion, lifetime pregnancies, genital ulcers, Neisseria
gonorrhoeae) were also associated with HIV infection. Among females, lifetime
sexual partners (linear trend, p<0.001), â‰¥2 partners in the past year (adjOR 2.0,
95%CI 1.4-2.8), â‰¥2 new partners in the past year (adjOR 1.9 95%CI 1.2, 3.3) and
concurrent partners in the past year (adjOR 1.6 95%CI 1.1, 2.4) were all
associated with HIV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts must be intensified to find effective interventions to
reduce HSV-2. Effective behavioural interventions focusing on reducing the number
of sexual partnerships and risk behaviour within partnerships are also needed. An
increase in risky sexual behaviour may occur following marriage dissolution or
when a young woman travels outside of her community and interventions addressing 
the needs of these subgroups of vulnerable women may be important.

Evaluation of a nonanal-trimethylamine lure for collection of Culex
quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) in gravid traps.

Gravid traps are useful tools for monitoring vector-borne pathogens in
mosquitoes, particularly for those pathogens transmitted by Culex
quinquefasciatus Say. One of the primary challenges in the use of gravid traps is
the necessity of the inclusion of an oviposition attractant, usually an infusion 
of organic material, which changes in attractiveness over time. However, a
standardized lure, using nonanal and trimethylamine (N + TMA), has been developed
and is commercially available. The N + TMA lure was tested against grass infusion
and tap water in Tanzania, where Cx. quinquefasciatus is a vector of lymphatic
filariasis. Traps baited with grass infusion collected significantly more
mosquitoes than N + TMA-baited traps, which collected significantly more than
traps baited with tap water. The advantages and disadvantages of the standardized
lure are discussed.

The African Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO AFRO) organized
the annual regional conference on immunization (ARCI) from 10 to 12 December 2012
in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, under the theme, "Innovations, access and the right
of all to vaccines". The meeting reviewed the status of immunization in the
region and identified all innovations, strategies and technologies available and 
how these could be fully utilized to enhance the access and the rights of all to 
vaccines. Over 50 oral presentations were made in plenary and parallel sessions
of the conference which was attended by over 200 participants drawn from national
immunization programs, academia, public health experts and immunization partners.
In addition there were 40 poster presentations. This manuscript summarizes of the
meeting, highlighting the innovations in immunization being piloted or scaled-up,
their impact and suggesting ways to further improve immunization service delivery
for the eradication, elimination and control of vaccine-preventable diseases in
the region.

BACKGROUND: Dietary changes characterized by a reduction in carbohydrate quality 
are occurring in developing countries and may be associated with a higher
prevalence of obesity and chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. We
assessed the preferences and acceptability of unrefined whole grain carbohydrate 
staples (i.e., brown rice, unrefined maize and unrefined sorghum ugali) as
substitutes for commonly consumed refined carbohydrates in Tanzania.
METHODS: A questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic information and
dietary habits, and pre-and post-tasting questionnaires were administered for
test foods. A 10-point LIKERT scale was used to rate attributes of the three test
foods.
RESULTS: White rice and refined maize ugali were the most commonly consumed
carbohydrate staples in this population; 98% and 91%, respectively. Occasional
consumption of unrefined maize and sorghum ugali was reported by 32% and 23% of
the participants, respectively. All of the test foods were highly rated for
smell, taste, color, appearance and texture. Taste was rated highest for
unrefined maize ugali. Almost all of the participants were willing to participate
in a future dietary intervention involving regular consumption of these unrefined
carbohydrates for at least six months duration.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that whole grain carbohydrates are highly
acceptable, and that there is a promising potential for their use in future
dietary intervention studies in Tanzania.

Gender-based distributional skewness of the United Republic of Tanzania's health 
workforce cadres: a cross-sectional health facility survey.

BACKGROUND: While severe shortages, inadequate skills and a geographical
imbalance of health personnel have been consistently documented over the years as
long term critical challenges in the health sector of the United Republic of
Tanzania, there is limited evidence on the gender-based distribution of the
health workforce and its likely implications. Extant evidence shows that some
people may not seek healthcare unless they have access to a provider of their
gender. This paper, therefore, assesses the gender-based distribution of the
United Republic of Tanzania's health workforce cadres.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data collected in a cross-sectional
health facility survey on health system strengthening in the United Republic of
Tanzania in 2008. During the survey, 88 health facilities, selected randomly from
8 regions, yielded 815 health workers (HWs) eligible for the current analysis.
While Chi-square was used for testing associations in the bivariate analysis,
multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression to assess the
relationship between gender and each of the cadres involved in the analysis.
RESULTS: The mean age of the HWs was 39.7, ranging from 15 to 63 years. Overall, 
75% of the HWs were women. The proportion of women among maternal and child
health aides or medical attendants (MCHA/MA), nurses and midwives was 86%, 86%
and 91%, respectively, while their proportion among clinical officers (COs) and
medical doctors (MDs) was 28% and 21%, respectively. Multivariate analysis
revealed that the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) that a HW was 
a female (baseline category is "male") for each cadre was: MCHA/MA, ORâ€‰=â€‰3.70,
95% CI 2.16-6.33; nurse, ORâ€‰=â€‰5.61, 95% CI 3.22-9.78; midwife, ORâ€‰=â€‰2.74, 95% CI 
1.44-5.20; CO, ORâ€‰=â€‰0.08, 95% CI 0.04-0.17 and MD, ORâ€‰=â€‰0.04, 95% CI 0.02-0.09.
CONCLUSION: The distribution of the United Republic of Tanzania's health cadres
is dramatically gender-skewed, a reflection of gender inequality in health career
choices. MCHA/MA, nursing and midwifery cadres are large and female-dominant,
whereas COs and MDs are fewer in absolute numbers and male-dominant. While a need
for more staff is necessary for an effective delivery of quality health services,
adequate representation of women in highly trained cadres is imperative to
enhance responses to some gender-specific roles and needs.

Detection of trypanosomes that cause disease in human beings and livestock within
their tsetse fly hosts is an essential component of vector and disease control
programmes. Several molecular-based diagnostic tests have been developed for this
purpose. Many of these tests, while sensitive, require analysis of trypanosome
DNA extracted from single flies, or from pooled tsetse fly heads and amplified
trypanosome DNA. In this study, we evaluated the relative analytical and
diagnostic sensitivities of two PCR-based tests (ITS and TBR) and a Trypanozoon
specific LAMP assay using pooled whole tsetse flies and midguts spiked with
serially diluted procyclics of a laboratory strain of Trypanosoma brucei brucei
(KETRI 3386). Test sensitivity was also evaluated using experimentally infected
tsetse flies. The aim was to determine the most appropriate pooling strategy for 
whole tsetse and midguts. RIME-LAMP had the highest diagnostic sensitivity (100%)
followed by TBR-PCR (95%) and ITS-PCR (50%) in detecting trypanosome DNA from
pooled tsetse midguts. RIME-LAMP also had the best diagnostic specificity (75%)
followed by ITS-PCR (68%) and TBR-PCR (50%). The relative detection limit
determined by serial dilution of procyclics was below 10(-6) (equivalent to
1parasite/ml). Using TBR-PCR, ITS-PCR and RIME-LAMP, it was possible to detect
trypanosome DNA in single flies or in pools of 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or 15
flies/midguts. The proportion of positive pools declined by up to 60% when
testing pools of 15 whole flies as opposed to testing pools of 5-10 flies.
Additionally, it was possible to detect DNA in a single infected tsetse fly in
the background of 4, 9, or 14 uninfected tsetse flies. Averaged across pool sizes
and tsetse species, RIME-LAMP detected the highest proportion of positive pools
in spiked whole tsetse and midguts (86.6% and 87.2%) followed by TBR-PCR (78. 6% 
and 79.2%) and ITS-PCR (34.3% and 40.2%). There were no significant differences
between the proportions of positive pools detected in whole flies and midguts. We
conclude that pooling of whole tsetse/midguts is an effective strategy to reduce 
hands-on-time and hence has potential application in large scale xenomonitoring
to generate epidemiological data for decision making. RIME-LAMP offers the best
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity on pooled tsetse midguts, thus
demonstrating its superior diagnostic performance when compared with TBR-PCR and 
ITS-PCR. Using pools of whole tsetse or midguts as source of DNA does not have
any significant effect on test results and is more representative of the field
conditions where the proportion of flies with infected midguts tends to be higher
than flies with infected salivary glands. Therefore to save time and minimize
costs, pooling of whole tsetse flies is recommended.

'The body we leave behind': a qualitative study of obstacles and opportunities
for increasing uptake of male circumcision among Tanzanian Christians.

Downs JA, Fuunay LD, Fuunay M, Mbago M, Mwakisole A, Peck RN, Downs DJ.

Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Male circumcision (MC) reduces HIV infection by approximately 60%
among heterosexual men and is recommended by the WHO for HIV prevention in
sub-Saharan Africa. In northwest Tanzania, over 60% of Muslims but less than 25% 
of Christian men are circumcised. We hypothesised that the decision to circumcise
may be heavily influenced by religious identity and that specific religious
beliefs may offer both obstacles and opportunities to increasing MC uptake, and
conducted focus group discussions to explore reasons for low rates of MC among
Christian church attenders in the region.
DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus group discussions and interpretative
phenomenological analysis.
SETTING: Discussions took place at churches in both rural and urban areas of the 
Mwanza region of northwest Tanzania.
PARTICIPANTS: We included 67 adult Christian churchgoers of both genders in a
total of 10 single-gender focus groups.
RESULTS: Christians frequently reported perceiving MC as a Muslim practice, as a 
practice for the sexually promiscuous, or as unnecessary since they are taught to
focus on 'circumcision of the heart'. Only one person had ever heard MC discussed
at church, but nearly all Christian parishioners were eager for their churches to
address MC and felt that MC could be consistent with their faith.
CONCLUSIONS: Christian religious beliefs among Tanzanian churchgoers provide both
obstacles and opportunities for increasing uptake of MC. Since half of adults in 
sub-Saharan Africa identify themselves as Christians, addressing these issues is 
critical for MC efforts in this region.

Department of Animal Morphology, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University, 
Umultowska 89, 61-614, Poznan, Poland. skoracki@amu.edu.pl

A new monotypic genus Colisyringophilus n. g. is established for C. tanzanicus n.
sp., quill mites parasitising two mouse bird species from Tanzania, Colius
striatus Gmelin and Urocolius macrourus (Linnaeus). This new genus is closely
related to Neoaulobia Fain, Bochkov & Mironov, 2000, but differs from it by the
following features: the stylophore is rounded posteriorly, the propodonotal
shield is reduced to triangular sclerite bearing bases of setae vi and ve, the
hysteronotal shield is absent, legs I are longer than legs II, and apodemes I are
distinctly elongated. This is the first record of syringophilid mites from hosts 
of the order Coliiformes.

es Salaam, Tanzania.

Background and Methods This cross-sectional study aimed at determining the
prevalence and risk factors for severe anemia, severe microcytic anemia, and
severe normocytic anemia among HIV-infected individuals aged >15 years.
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors 
for anemia.ResultsData from 40Â 408 patients were analyzed, showing an overall
prevalence of 22% for severe anemia. The risk of developing severe anemia
increased by 49% among patients with a body mass index of <18.5 kg/m(2), by
approximately 2-fold among patients with the World Health Organization (WHO)
stage III, and by 3-fold among patients with WHO stage IV illness. Severe
normocytic anemia was uniquely increased among patients aged â‰¥50 years, among
those with chronic diarrhea and Kaposi sarcoma, and those taking
cotrimoxazole.ConclusionThere was a high prevalence of severe anemia among adults
infected with HIV. Focused identification of anemia should be based on the
hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume measurements.

Oral diseases affect some 3.9 billion people.

Richards D.

Centre for Evidence-based Dentistry, Oxford, UK.

Comment on
    J Dent Res. 2013 Jul;92(7):592-7.

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Lilacs.
STUDY SELECTION: Published and unpublished observational population-based studies
presenting information on the prevalence, incidence, case fatality and
cause-specific mortality related to untreated caries, severe periodontitis and
severe tooth loss between January 1980 and December 2010. There were no language 
restrictions. Study quality was assessed using the STROBE checklist
(http://www.strobe-statement.org/).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Prevalence estimates were calculated on the
database for all age-gender-country-year groups using a specifically developed
Bayesian meta-regression tool. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and years
lived with disability (YLDs) metrics were used to quantify the disease burden.
Disability weights were calculated based on population-based surveys in five
countries (USA, Peru, Tanzania, Bangladesh and Indonesia) and an open Internet
survey. Uncertainties in estimates were examined using Monte Carlo simulation
techniques with uncertainty levels presented as the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles,
which can be interpreted as a 95% UI.
RESULTS: Oral diseases remain highly prevalent in 2010 affecting 3.9 billion
people. Untreated caries in permanent teeth was the most prevalent condition
evaluated for the entire GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2010 Study with a global 
prevalence of 35% for all ages combined. Severe periodontitis and untreated
caries in deciduous teeth were the 6th and 10th most prevalent conditions,
affecting, respectively, 11% and 9% of the global population. Oral conditions
combined accounted for 15 million DALYs globally (1.9% of all YLDs and 0.6% of
all DALYs), implying an average health loss of 224 years per 100,000 people.
DALYs due to oral conditions increased 20.8% between 1990 and 2010, mainly due to
population growth and aging. While DALYs due to severe periodontitis and
untreated caries increased, those due to severe tooth loss decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the challenge in responding to the diversity 
of urgent oral health needs world-wide, particularly in developing communities.

Understanding disease vector composition is of priority in designing effective
disease control programs. In integrated vector control management, understanding 
of disease vector species among species complexes simplifies priorities for
effective control tools selection. This study identified members of the Anopheles
funestus complex sampled in western Kenya from 2002 to 2011 from different
breeding sites. Larval sampling was carried out using the standard dipper (350ml)
in larval habitats in western Kenya highlands from January 2002 to December 2012.
The morphologically identified An. funestus larvae were preserved in absolute
ethanol for molecular identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among
the 184 identified specimens of An. funestus sampled, only 76 specimens were
clearly identified after DNA amplification and PCR. Among these, 25 (32.9%) were 
An. funestus s.s, 22 (28.9%) An. leesoni, 9 (11.8%) An. rivulorum and 20 (26.3%) 
were An. vaneedeni. None was identified as An. parensis. This study has
demonstrated the existence of the siblings species of An. funestus complex in
western Kenya highlands. However, there is need for further studies to evaluate
the dynamics of the adults and sporozoite infectivity rates throughout the region
based on these findings.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of misoprostol among patients with
retained placenta in a low-resource setting.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial was carried out in Tanzania between April 2008 and November 2011. It
included patients who delivered at a gestational age of 28 weeks or more and had 
blood loss of 750 mL or less at 30 minutes after delivery. Sublingual misoprostol
(800 Î¼g) was compared with placebo as the primary treatment. Power analysis
showed that 117 patients would be required to observe a reduction of 40% in the
incidence of manual removal of the placenta (MRP; P=0.05, 80% power), the primary
outcome. The secondary outcomes were blood loss and number of blood transfusions.
RESULTS: Interim analysis after recruitment of 95 patients showed that incidence 
of MRP, total blood loss, and incidence of blood transfusions were similar in the
misoprostol (MRP, 40%; blood loss, 803 mL; blood transfusion, 15%) and placebo
(MRP, 33%, blood loss 787 mL, blood transfusion, 23%) groups. The trial was
stopped because continuation would not alter the interim conclusion that
misoprostol was ineffective.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with misoprostol was found to have no clinically
significant beneficial effect among women with retained placenta.

Natural radioactivity in soil and water from likuyu village in the neighborhood
of mkuju uranium deposit.

Mohammed NK, Mazunga MS.

Department of Physics, University of Dar es Salaam, P.O. Box 35063, Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.

The discovery of high concentration uranium deposit at Mkuju, southern part of
Tanzania, has brought concern about the levels of natural radioactivity at
villages in the neighborhood of the deposit. This study determined the
radioactivity levels of 30 soil samples and 20 water samples from Likuyu village 
which is 54â€‰km east of the uranium deposit. The concentrations of the natural
radionuclides (238)U, (232)Th, and (40)K were determined using low level gamma
spectrometry of the Tanzania Atomic Energy Commission (TAEC) Laboratory in
Arusha. The average radioactivity concentrations obtained in soil samples for
(238)U (51.7â€‰Bq/kg), (232)Th (36.4â€‰Bq/kg), and (40)K (564.3â€‰Bq/kg) were higher
than the worldwide average concentrations value of these radionuclides reported
by UNSCEAR, 2000. The average activity concentration value of (238)U (2.35â€‰Bq/L) 
and (232)Th (1.85â€‰Bq/L) in water samples was similar and comparable to their mean
concentrations in the control sample collected from Nduluma River in Arusha.

OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is believed to be an increasingly common driver of the
epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in sub-Saharan Africa, but
prospective data are scarce. The objective of this prospective study was to
determine the contribution of hypertension to deaths, admissions, and hospital
days at a Tanzanian zonal hospital.
METHODS: Between 2009 and 2011, diagnoses were recorded for all medical
admissions together with age, sex, length of hospitalization and in-hospital
mortality.
RESULTS: Among 11â€Š045 consecutive admissions, NCDs accounted for nearly half of
all deaths, admissions, and hospital days. Among NCDs, hypertension-related
diseases were the most common and accounted for 314 (33.9%) of the total NCD
deaths, 1611 (29.9%) of the NCD admissions, and 12â€Š837 (27.8%) NCD hospital days.
Stroke (167 deaths) was the leading cause of hypertension-related death.
Hypertension was the leading cause of death in patients over the age of 50 years 
and 57% of hypertension-related deaths occurred in patients less than 65 years
old.
CONCLUSION: NCDs account for half of all deaths, admissions and hospital days at 
our Tanzanian hospital and hypertension-related diseases were the most common
NCD. Hypertension accounted for 34% of NCD deaths and 15% of all deaths.
Hypertension was the second most common cause of death overall and the leading
cause of death in patients more than 50 years old. More than half of
hypertension-related deaths occurred before retirement age. These findings have
important implications for public health and medical education in sub-Saharan
Africa, wherein hypertension and related diseases have not traditionally been
given a high priority.

The mangrove nursery paradigm revisited: otolith stable isotopes support
nursery-to-reef movements by Indo-Pacific fishes.

Kimirei IA, Nagelkerken I, Mgaya YD, Huijbers CM.

Radboud University Nijmegen, Institute for Water and Wetland Research, Department
of Animal Ecology and Ecophysiology, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Mangroves and seagrass beds have long been perceived as important nurseries for
many fish species. While there is growing evidence from the Western Atlantic that
mangrove habitats are intricately connected to coral reefs through ontogenetic
fish migrations, there is an ongoing debate of the value of these coastal
ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific. The present study used natural tags, viz. otolith
stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, to investigate for the first time the degree
to which multiple tropical juvenile habitats subsidize coral reef fish
populations in the Indo Pacific (Tanzania). Otoliths of three reef fish species
(Lethrinus harak, L. lentjan and Lutjanus fulviflamma) were collected in
mangrove, seagrass and coral reef habitats and analyzed for stable isotope ratios
in the juvenile and adult otolith zones. Î´(13)C signatures were significantly
depleted in the juvenile compared to the adult zones, indicative of different
habitat use through ontogeny. Maximum likelihood analysis identified that 82% of 
adult reef L. harak had resided in either mangrove (29%) or seagrass (53%) or
reef (18%) habitats as juveniles. Of adult L. fulviflamma caught from offshore
reefs, 99% had passed through mangroves habitats as juveniles. In contrast, L.
lentjan adults originated predominantly from coral reefs (65-72%) as opposed to
inshore vegetated habitats (28-35%). This study presents conclusive evidence for 
a nursery role of Indo-Pacific mangrove habitats for reef fish populations. It
shows that intertidal habitats that are only temporarily available can form an
important juvenile habitat for some species, and that reef fish populations are
often replenished by multiple coastal habitats. Maintaining connectivity between 
inshore vegetated habitats and coral reefs, and conserving habitat mosaics rather
than single nursery habitats, is a major priority for the sustainability of
various Indo Pacific fish populations.

INTRODUCTION: Outcome assessment is the standard for evaluating the quality of
health services worldwide. In this study, outcome has been divided into immediate
and final outcome. Aim was to compare an intervention hospital with a Continuous 
Quality Improvement approach to a control group using benchmark assessments of
immediate outcome indicators in surgical care. Results were compared to final
outcome indicators.
METHOD: Surgical care quality in six hospitals in Tanzania was assessed from
2006-2011, using the Hospital Performance Assessment Tool. Independent observers 
assessed structural, process and outcome quality using checklists based on
evidence-based guidelines. The number of surgical key procedures over the
benchmark of 80% was compared between the intervention hospital and the control
group. Results were compared to Case Fatality Rates.
RESULTS: In the intervention hospital, in 2006, two of nine key procedures
reached the benchmark, one in 2009, and four in 2011. In the control group, one
of nine key procedures reached the benchmark in 2006, one in 2009, and none in
2011. Case Fatality Rate for all in-patients in the intervention hospital was
5.5% (nâ€Š=â€Š12,530) in 2006, 3.5% (nâ€Š=â€Š21,114) in 2009 and 4.6% (nâ€Š=â€Š18,840) in
2011. In the control group it was 3.1% (nâ€Š=â€Š17,827) in 2006, 4.2% (nâ€Š=â€Š13,632) in
2009 and 3.8% (nâ€Š=â€Š17,059) in 2011.
DISCUSSION: Results demonstrated that quality assurance improved performance
levels in both groups. After the introduction of Continuous Quality Improvement, 
performance levels improved further in the intervention hospital while quality in
the district hospital did not. Immediate outcome indicators appeared to be a
better steering tool for quality improvement compared to final outcome
indicators. Immediate outcome indicators revealed a need for improvement in pre- 
and postoperative care.
CONCLUSION: Quality assurance programs based on immediate outcome indicators can 
be effective if embedded in Continuous Quality Improvement. Nevertheless, final
outcome indicators cannot be neglected.

Division of Epidemiology, Leeds Institute of Genetics, Health and Therapeutics,
University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA), Dar es 
Salaam, Tanzania; Department of Food Science and Technology, Sokoine University
of Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania.

SCOPE: The study aims to evaluate the status of dietary exposure to aflatoxin and
fumonisin in young Tanzanian children, using previously validated biomarkers of
exposure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 148 children aged 12-22 months, were recruited
from three geographically distant villages in Tanzania; Nyabula, Kigwa, and
Kikelelwa. Plasma aflatoxin-albumin adducts (AF-alb) and urinary fumonisin B1
(UFB1) were measured by ELISA and LC-MS, respectively. AF-alb was detectable in
84% of children, was highest in fully weaned children (p < 0.01) with higher
levels being associated with higher maize intake (p < 0.05). AF-alb geometric
mean (95% CI) was 43.2 (28.7-65.0), 19.9 (13.5-29.2), and 3.6 (2.8-4.7) pg/mg
albumin in children from Kigwa, Nyabula, and Kikelelwa, respectively. UFB1 was
detectable in 96% of children and the level was highest in children who had been 
fully weaned (p < 0.01). The geometric UFB1 mean (95% CI) was 327.2
(217.1-493.0), 211.7 (161.1-278.1), and 82.8 (58.3-117.7) pg/mL in Kigwa,
Nyabula, and Kikelelwa, respectively. About 82% of all the children were exposed 
to both mycotoxins.
CONCLUSION: Young children in Tanzania are chronically exposed to both aflatoxin 
and fumonisin through contaminated diet, although the level of exposure varies
markedly between the three villages studied.

BACKGROUND: Adherence to antiretroviral drugs in the treatment of paediatric HIV 
infection is complicated because of many factors including stigma and drug intake
logistics. It is therefore important to identify children with non-adherence in
order to intervene before they become at risk of developing treatment failure or 
drug resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the level of adherence to
antiretroviral therapy (ART), measured by caretaker report, medication return and
nevirapine plasma concentration. In addition, the association between level of
adherence and patient's immune status was compared across the three methods of
measuring adherence.
METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving HIV infected
children aged 2-14 years, on nevirapine- based antiretroviral treatment for at
least six months, attending care and treatment clinic in three municipal
hospitals in Dar- Es- Salaam City. Eligible patients and their accompanying
caretakers were consecutively enrolled after obtaining written informed consent. 
Structured questionnaires were administered to caretakers to assess patient's
adherence by caretaker report and medication return whereas a single blood sample
for CD4 cell count/percent and determination of nevirapine plasma concentration
was taken from patients on the day of assessment.
RESULTS: A total of 300 patients and accompanying caretakers were enrolled and
the mean patient age (SD) was 8 (3) years. Caretakers' report and medication
return showed good adherence (98% and 97%) respectively. However, the level of
adherence assessed by nevirapine plasma concentration (85%) was significantly
lower than caretaker report and medication return (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The agreement
between nevirapine plasma concentration and medication return and between
nevirapine plasma concentration and caretaker report was weak (kâ€‰=â€‰0. 131)
(kâ€‰=â€‰0. 09) respectively. Nevirapine plasma concentration below 3 Î¼g/ml was
associated with immunosuppression (pâ€‰=â€‰0. 021) whereas medication return (>5% of 
prescribed doses) and caretaker reported missing more than one dose within 72
hours prior to interview were not associated with immunosuppression (pâ€‰=â€‰0. 474),
(pâ€‰=â€‰0. 569) respectively.
CONCLUSION: Lower adherence level observed using nevirapine plasma concentration 
and its association with immunological response supports the validity of the
method and indicates that adherence data obtained from caretaker report and
medication return may overestimate the true adherence in paediatric
antiretroviral therapy.

Event-level association between alcohol use and unprotected sex during last sex: 
evidence from population-based surveys in sub-Saharan Africa.

Kiene SM, Subramanian SV.

Department of Community Medicine and Health Care, University of Connecticut
School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA. kiene@uchc.edu

BACKGROUND: HIV and risky alcohol use are intertwined public health issues in
sub-Saharan Africa. Research supports the association between alcohol and
unprotected sex, but there is limited data using event-level analysis to examine 
this relationship.
METHODS: Using data from Demographic Health Surveys and AIDS Information Surveys 
collected in 8 sub-Saharan African countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Rwanda,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) drunkenness (reporting male partner or
both male and female partner being drunk during last sexual intercourse) at last 
sex was tested as a predictor of unprotected last sex among the male (n = 24,512)
and female (n = 28,229) participants. Partner type, HIV test results, and the
other variables were evaluated as effect modifiers of this relationship.
RESULTS: Drunkenness at last sex had a negative effect on the likelihood of
condom use among men (AOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) and a marginally significant
effect among women (AOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.59-1.02) in Southern Africa. However, for 
men in Southern Africa, this effect was primarily observed with steady partners. 
Contrary to predictions, in both Southern and Eastern Africa, for men,
drunkenness during sex with casual partners increased the odds of condom use.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a need to implement HIV prevention efforts that 
consider the role of alcohol use in precipitating unprotected sex and how it
varies based upon partner type.

A good night's sleep and the habit of net use: perceptions of risk and reasons
for bed net use in Bukoba and Zanzibar.

Koenker HM, Loll D, Rweyemamu D, Ali AS.

Programs, Baltimore, MD, USA. hkoenker@jhuccp.org

BACKGROUND: Intensive malaria control interventions in the United Republic of
Tanzania have contributed to reductions in malaria prevalence. Given that malaria
control remains reliant upon continued use of long-lasting insecticidal bed nets 
(LLINs) even when the threat of malaria has been reduced, this qualitative study 
sought to understand how changes in perceived risk influence LLIN usage, and to
explore in more detail the benefits of net use that are unrelated to malaria.
METHODS: Eleven focus group discussions were conducted in Bukoba Rural district
and in Zanzibar Urban West district in late 2011. Participants were males aged 18
and over, females between the ages of 18 and 49, and females at least 50 years
old.
RESULTS: The perceived risk of malaria had decreased among the respondents, and
malaria control interventions were credited for the decline. Participants cited
reductions in both the severity of malaria and in their perceived susceptibility 
to malaria. However, malaria was still considered a significant threat.
Participants' conceptualization of risk appeared to be an important consideration
for net use. At the same time, comfort and aspects of comfort (getting a good
night's sleep, avoiding biting pests) appeared to play a large role in personal
decisions to use nets consistently or not. Barriers to comfort (feeling
uncomfortable or trapped; perceived difficulty breathing, or itching/rashes) were
frequently cited as reasons not to use a net consistently. While it was apparent 
that participants acknowledged the malaria-prevention benefits of net use, the
exploration of the risk and comfort determinants of net use provides a richer
understanding of net use behaviours, particularly in a setting where transmission
has fallen and yet consistent net use is still crucial to maintaining those
gains.
CONCLUSION: Future behaviour change communication campaigns should capitalize on 
the non-malaria benefits of net use that provide a long-term rationale for
consistent use even when the immediate threat of malaria transmission has been
reduced.

BACKGROUND: The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), a compulsory formal sector
scheme took over the management of the Community Health Fund (CHF), a voluntary
informal sector scheme, in 2009. This study assesses the origins of the reform,
its effect on management and reporting structures, financial flow adequacy,
reform communication and acceptability to key stakeholders, and initial progress 
towards universal coverage.
METHODS: The study relied on national data sources and an in-depth collective
case study of a rural and an urban district to assess awareness and acceptability
of the reform, and fund availability and use relative to need in a sample of
facilities.
RESULTS: The reform was driven by a national desire to expand coverage and
increase access to services. Despite initial delays, the CHF has been embedded
within the NHIF organisational structure, bringing more intensive and qualified
supervision closer to the district. National CHF membership has more than
doubled. However, awareness of the reform was limited below the district level
due to the reform's top-down nature. The reform was generally acceptable to key
stakeholders, who expected that benefits between schemes would be harmonised.The 
reform was unable to institute changes to the CHF design or district management
structures because it has so far been unable to change CHF legislation which also
limits facility capacity to use CHF revenue. Further, revenue generated is
currently insufficient to offset treatment and administration costs, and the
reform did not improve the revenue to cost ratio. Administrative costs are also
likely to have increased as a result of the reform.
CONCLUSION: Informal sector schemes can benefit from merger with formal sector
schemes through improved data systems, supervision, and management support.
However, effects will be maximised if legal frameworks can be harmonised early on
and a reduction in administrative costs is not guaranteed.

Standardizing and scaling up quality adolescent friendly health services in
Tanzania.

Department of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization, 20
Avenue Appia, Geneva 27 CH-1211, Switzerland. chandramouliv@who.int

BACKGROUND: Adolescents in Tanzania require health services that respond to their
sexual and reproductive health - and other - needs and are delivered in a
friendly and nonjudgemental manner. Systematizing and expanding the reach of
quality adolescent friendly health service provision is part of the Tanzanian
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare's (MOHSW) multi-component strategy to
promote and safeguard the health of adolescents.
OBJECTIVE: We set out to identify the progress made by the MOHSW in achieving the
objective it had set in its National Adolescent Health and Development Strategy: 
2002-2006, to systematize and extend the reach of Adolescent Friendly Health
Services (AFHS) in the country.
METHODS: We reviewed plans and reports from the MOHSW and journal articles on
AFHS. This was supplemented with several of the authors' experiences of working
to make health services in Tanzania adolescent friendly.
RESULTS: The MOHSW identified four key problems with what was being done to make 
health services adolescent friendly in the country - firstly, it was not fully
aware of the various efforts under way; secondly, there was no standardized
definition of AFHS; thirdly, it had received reports that the quality of the AFHS
being provided by some organizations was poor; and fourthly, only small numbers
of adolescents were being reached by the efforts that were under way. The MOHSW
responded to these problems by mapping existing services, developing a
standardized definition of AFHS, charting out what needed to be done to improve
their quality and expand their coverage, and integrating AFHS within wider policy
and strategy documents and programmatic measurement instruments. It has also
taken important preparatory steps to stimulate and support implementation.
CONCLUSION: The MOHSW is aware that the focus of the effort must now shift from
the national to the regional, council and local levels. The onus is on regional
and council health management teams as well as health facility managers to take
the steps needed to ensure that all adolescents in the country obtain the sexual 
and reproductive health (SRH) services they need, delivered in a friendly and
non-judgemental manner. But they cannot do this without substantial and ongoing
support.

Associations between attitudes toward violence and intimate partner violence in
South Africa and Tanzania.

Department of Health Promotion and Development, Faculty of Psychology, University
of Bergen, Norway. annegreet.wubs@iuh.uib.no

Attitude change approaches are common in the prevention of intimate partner
violence (IPV) among adolescents. This study examined associations between
perpetration or victimization and attitudes toward IPV with data from a
longitudinal randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an HIV prevention intervention 
among school students in three sites in South Africa and Tanzania. Data analyses 
were confined to students from the control group only, and to those with
experience with romantic relationships. Boys and those more involved with
violence reported more violence-supportive attitudes. For Cape Town (and to some 
extent Mankweng), the results of prospective prediction are consistent with the
notion of a bidirectional attitudes-behavior interrelationship. For Dar es Salaam
attitudes predicted behavior prospectively; however, prediction in the opposite
direction was not confirmed. These results indicate that attitude change
strategies may be useful complementary to structural approaches also in global
South settings, although their effectiveness may vary.

Malaria risk factors in North West Tanzania: the effect of spraying, nets and
wealth.

Malaria prevalence remains high in many African countries despite massive
scaling-up of insecticide treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). 
This paper evaluates the protective effect of pyrethroid IRS and ITNs in relation
to risk factors for malaria based on a study conducted in North-West Tanzania,
where IRS has been conducted since 2007 and universal coverage of ITNs has been
carried out recently. In 2011 community-based cross-sectional surveys were
conducted in the two main malaria transmission periods that occur after the short
and long rainy seasons. These included 5,152 and 4,325 children aged 0.5-14
years, respectively. Data on IRS and ITN coverage, household demographics and
socio-economic status were collected using an adapted version of the Malaria
Indicator Survey. Children were screened for malaria by rapid diagnostic test. In
the second survey, haemoglobin density was measured and filter paper blood spots 
were collected to determine age-specific sero-prevalence in each community
surveyed. Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in children 0.5-14 years old
was 9.3% (95%CI:5.9-14.5) and 22.8% (95%CI:17.3-29.4) in the two surveys. Risk
factors for infection after the short rains included households not being sprayed
(ORâ€Š=â€Š0.39; 95%CI:0.20-0.75); low community net ownership (ORâ€Š=â€Š0.45;
95%CI:0.21-0.95); and low community SES (least poor vs. poorest tertile:
ORâ€Š=â€Š0.13, 95%CI:0.05-0.34). Risk factors after the long rains included household
poverty (per quintile increase: ORâ€Š=â€Š0.89; 95%CI:0.82-0.97) and community poverty
(least poor vs. poorest tertile: ORâ€Š=â€Š0.26, 95%CI:0.15-0.44); household IRS or
high community ITN ownership were not protective. Despite high IRS coverage and
equitable LLIN distribution, poverty was an important risk factor for malaria
suggesting it could be beneficial to target additional malaria control activities
to poor households and communities. High malaria prevalence in some clusters and 
the limited protection given by pyrethroid IRS and LLINs suggest that it may be
necessary to enhance established vector control activities and consider
additional interventions.

Eliminating malaria vectors.

Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania. gkilleen@ihi.or.tz

Malaria vectors which predominantly feed indoors upon humans have been locally
eliminated from several settings with insecticide treated nets (ITNs), indoor
residual spraying or larval source management. Recent dramatic declines of An.
gambiae in east Africa with imperfect ITN coverage suggest mosquito populations
can rapidly collapse when forced below realistically achievable, non-zero
thresholds of density and supporting resource availability. Here we explain why
insecticide-based mosquito elimination strategies are feasible, desirable and can
be extended to a wider variety of species by expanding the vector control arsenal
to cover a broader spectrum of the resources they need to survive. The greatest
advantage of eliminating mosquitoes, rather than merely controlling them, is that
this precludes local selection for behavioural or physiological resistance
traits. The greatest challenges are therefore to achieve high biological coverage
of targeted resources rapidly enough to prevent local emergence of resistance and
to then continually exclude, monitor for and respond to re-invasion from external
populations.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal tuberculosis continues to be a major public health problem 
worldwide and poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to general surgeons
practicing in resource-limited countries. This study was conducted to describe
the clinicopathological profile and outcome of surgical treatment of abdominal
tuberculosis in our setting and compare with what is described in literature.
METHODS: A prospective descriptive study of patients who presented with abdominal
tuberculosis was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) in northwestern
Tanzania from January 2006 to February 2012. Ethical approval to conduct the
study was obtained from relevant authorities. Statistical data analysis was
performed using SPSS version 17.0.
RESULTS: Out of 256 patients enrolled in the study, males outnumbered females.
The median age was 28 years (range = 16-68 years). The majority of patients
(77.3%) had primary abdominal tuberculosis. A total of 127 (49.6%) patients
presented with intestinal obstruction, 106 (41.4%) with peritonitis, 17 (6.6%)
with abdominal masses and 6 (2.3%) patients with multiple fistulae in ano.
Forty-eight (18.8%) patients were HIV positive. A total of 212 (82.8%) patients
underwent surgical treatment for abdominal tuberculosis. Bands /adhesions (58.5%)
were the most common operative findings. Ileo-caecal region was the most common
bowel involved in 122 (57.5%) patients. Release of adhesions and bands was the
most frequent surgical procedure performed in 58.5% of cases. Complication and
mortality rates were 29.7% and 18.8% respectively. The overall median length of
hospital stay was 32 days and was significantly longer in patients with
complications (p < 0.001). Advanced age (age â‰¥ 65 years), co-morbid illness, late
presentation, HIV positivity and CD4+ count < 200 cells/Î¼l were statistically
significantly associated with mortality (p < 0.0001). The follow up of patients
were generally poor as only 37.5% of patients were available for follow up at
twelve months after discharge.
CONCLUSION: Abdominal tuberculosis constitutes a major public health problem in
our environment and presents a diagnostic challenge requiring a high index of
clinical suspicion. Early diagnosis, early anti-tuberculous therapy and surgical 
treatment of the associated complications are essential for survival.

OBJECTIVE: To improve the knowledge of Kaposi sarcoma and the relationship
between Kaposi sarcoma and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and to
improve the ability to diagnose and treat Kaposi sarcoma and acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
METHODS: Symptoms, signs and results of 121 patients encountered in the
department of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery in Tanzania, who was
diagnosed as Kaposi sarcoma actually with HIV infection and AIDS, were
retrospectively analyzed in this study.
RESULTS: There were 46 males and 75 females with age ranged from 5 to 65 years,
medium 30 year. The mucous membranes and skin lesions was the most commonly seen 
clinical manifestation in 121 cases, these lesions appeared as raised blotches or
lumps that might be purple, brown, or red, early stages typical lesions began as 
flat or slightly raised colored spots. Among the cases reported here, 25 patients
(20.66%) showed progressive nose blockage and nose bleeding and the purple-red
new-grows were found in the nose of these patients. Fifteen patients (12.40%) had
flat or slightly raised colored spots in their mucous membrane of mouth (palate
or tongue), and in other 7 patients, purple small lumps were found in the gums of
the patients. There were same lesions in their pharynx in 9 cases. In 10 patients
(8.26%), Kaposi sarcoma was found in tonsil looked like tonsillitis with enlarged
tonsils by two to three degree. Twelve patients (9.92%) had masses in the neck
with no pain. Thirty-five patients (28.92%)had lesions of purple black nodules,
including 10 patients who had the same lesions with ulcer formation in the
nodules. All patients had been followed-up for at least two-years. Eighty-five
patients passed away in one year, survival rate of one year was 21.48% (26/121), 
only 12 patients survived from the disease over two years, two years' survival
rate was 9.92% (12/121).
CONCLUSIONS: Kaposi sarcoma is the characteristic disease for AIDS, mainly found 
on the membranes and skin. These lesions appears as raised blotches or lumps that
may be purple, brown, or red, early stages typical lesions begin as flat or
slightly raised colored spots. Patients who had kaposi sarcoma often died in a
short-time without treatment.

Epiphytic cyanobacteria of the seagrass Cymodocea rotundata: diversity, diel nifH
expression and nitrogenase activity.

Seagrasses are photoautotrophic, ecologically important components of many
globally widespread coastal ecosystems, in which combined nitrogen may limit
their production. We examined the biodiversity and diazotrophic capacity of
microbial epiphytes associated with the phyllosphere of the seagrass Cymodocea
rotundata of the Western Indian Ocean. Light microscopy, 16S rRNA and nifH gene
analysis revealed the dominance of cyanobacteria in the epiphytic microbial
community. Most phylotypes were related to free-living uncultured benthic
cyanobacteria, while some to cyanobacterial endosymbionts of marine diatoms.
Novel and potentially diazotrophic species, some of known pantropical
distribution, were also discovered. Significant diel nitrogenase activities
(acetylene reduction assay) were recorded (up to 358 Â± 232 nmol C2H4 g(-1) of
seagrass FW h(-1)). The nifH gene expression patterns showed that heterocystous
phylotypes may be the dominant diazotrophs during the day and non-heterocystous
at night. These data show that C.â€‰rotundata is colonized by diverse diazotrophic 
cyanobacteria species and suggest that these may be beneficial partners of
seagrasses in nitrogen-depleted waters.

A review of pig pathology in Tanzania.

Wilson RT, Swai E.

Bartridge Partners, Bartridge House, Umberleigh, Devon EX37 9AS, UK.
trevorbart@aol.com

The approximately 1.58 million pigs in Tanzania represent 3.7% of the national
population of quadruped meat-producing animals. Pigs are kept mainly by small
producers who own 99.5% of the national stock in units that average 3.04 animals 
(range 2-48). Government policy has had little practical application. African
swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and Cysticercosis are important diseases. The
first two are notifiable diseases under Tanzania legislation; the last has
widespread distribution and relevance as a major zoonosis. Ascariasis (Ascaris
suum), hydatidosis (Echinococcus granulosus), leptospirosis (Leptospira
interrogans) and thermophilic Campylobacter are other zoonoses associated with
pigs. Gastrointestinal helminths and external parasites, especially Sarcoptes
scabiei, are common. Risk factors associated with cysticercosis for humans
working with pigs or eating their meat include the free-range or semi-confined
management systems, the use of rivers or ponds as a source of water, lack of
household sanitation, informal home slaughter, pork not being inspected at
slaughter slabs and undercooked and barbecued meat. Pigs are a minor component of
Tanzania's livestock sector but there is potential for increasing their
contribution to human welfare. Prospects are enhanced by the shorter life cycle, 
greater number of young produced per year and the possibility of producing
high-quality animal protein at a lower cost than meat produced by cattle and
small ruminants.

HIV Stigma and Specified Correlates in North India.

Nebhinani N, Mattoo SK, Wanchu A.

Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute Medical Science, Rohtak,
Haryana, India.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the stigma and discrimination impede HIV-AIDS programs
across the continuum of prevention to care. We studied stigma and related issues 
in HIV-positive subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a tertiary care hospital in North India, we studied 100
HIV-positive outpatients not receiving antiretroviral therapy. The subjects
self-administered 'Tanzania Stigma Indicator and Community Endline-Individual
Questionnaire'. Psychiatric morbidity was screened with General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ-I2 Hindi) and diagnosed with Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV (SCID).
RESULTS: A typical subject was middle aged (25-44 years, 77%), school
non-completer (63%), village dweller (61%), and male (59%). Only 35 subjects
could differentiate between HIV and AIDS, and only 24 were aware of
antiretroviral therapy. Unprotected sex, sharing injections, and blood
transfusions were reported spontaneously as possible sources of transmission by
56-79% subjects each. About 80% of subjects reported no fear in touching
HIV-positive subjects or their objects. Avoiding injections, being faithful to
uninfected partner, avoiding blood transfusions, using condoms, and avoiding
sharing razors/blades were reported spontaneously as HIV preventive measures by
40 to 26 subjects each. Half of the subjects blamed self for contracting HIV.
Only 38 subjects reported others behaving differently with HIV-positive subjects.
HIV status disclosure was reported by 98 subjects (73 to family or relatives).
Urban subjects reported higher primary stigma and shame or blame. Psychiatric
disorders, present in 45 subjects, showed no association with stigma items.
CONCLUSIONS: The subjects had a limited knowledge, especially of treatment
aspects. Stigma showed no association with psychiatric disorders. The study
reflects a strong need for public health measures to enhance awareness and
knowledge about HIV/AIDS.

hypertensive patients in Tanzania.

Chillo P, Lwakatare J, Rieck AE, Lutale J, Gerdts E.

Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen , Norway.

Aim. To assess prevalence, type and covariates of abnormal left ventricular (LV) 
geometry in untreated native Tanzanian patients with hypertension in relation to 
normotensive controls. Methods. Echocardiography was performed in 161 untreated
hypertensive outpatients and 80 normotensive controls at a tertiary hospital in
Tanzania. Hypertensive heart disease was defined as presence of increased LV mass
or relative wall thickness (RWT). Results. The prevalence of hypertensive heart
disease increased with the severity of hypertension and was on average 62.1%
among patients and 12.5% in controls. In multivariate analyses, higher LV mass
index was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (Î² = 0.28), body mass
index (Î² = 0.20), peak early transmitral to medial mitral annulus velocity ratio 
(Î² = 0.16), and with lower stress-corrected midwall shortening (scMWS) (Î² = -
0.44) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (Î² = - 0.16), all p < 0.05. Higher
RWT was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (Î² = 0.16), longer E-wave 
deceleration time (Î² = 0.23) and lower scMWS (Î² = - 0.66), irrespective of LV
mass (all p < 0.05). Conclusion. Subclinical hypertensive heart disease is highly
prevalent in untreated native hypertensive Tanzanians and associated with both
systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction. Management of hypertension in Africans
should include high focus on subclinical hypertensive heart disease.

Single dose of gentamicin in combination with metronidazole versus multiple doses
for prevention of post-caesarean infection at Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza,
Tanzania: a randomized, equivalence, controlled trial.

Lyimo FM, Massinde AN, Kidenya BR, Konje ET, Mshana SE.

Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Catholic University of Health Sciences 
and Allied Science, Box 1464, Mwanza, Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Caesarean section(C/S) has been found to increase rates of maternal
infectious morbidities five times more than vaginal delivery. The provision of
intravenous prophylactic antibiotics 30 to 60 minutes prior to C/S has been found
to substantially reduce post-caesarean infection. At Bugando Medical Centre,
there is no consistent protocol for the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis 
to patients who are undergoing emergency C/S. Providing repeated dosages of
antibiotic prophylaxis after C/S is the common practice. This study aimed to
determine the comparative efficacy of a single dose of gentamicin in combination 
with metronidazole versus multiple doses for prevention of post-caesarean
infection.
METHODS: From October 2011 to May 2012, a randomized, equivalence, non-blinding
clinical trial was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza, Tanzania. A
total of 500 eligible participants were enrolled in the study and were randomly
allocated into two study arms -- "A" and "B". Participants in "A" received a
single dose of gentamicin in combination with metronidazole 30 to 60 minutes
prior to the operation, and participants in "B" received the same drugs prior to 
the operation but continued with for 24 hours. Both groups had 30 days of
follow-up and were assessed for signs and symptoms of surgical-site infection as 
the primary outcome. The equivalence margin was set at 5%. The two-tailed
equivalence was analyzed based on intention- to-treat analysis.
RESULTS: The randomization was proper, as the distribution of various demographic
and other baseline characteristics had a p-value of > 0.05. All 500 participants 
were included in our analysis; of these, no participants were lost to follow-up. 
Surgical-site infection occurred in 12 out of the 250 (4.8%) receiving single
dose compared to 16 out of the 250 (6.4%) receiving multiple doses. There is an
absolute proportion difference of 1.6% (95% Confidence interval: -2.4 - 5.6%)
which lies outside the pre-specified 5% equivalence margin.
CONCLUSION: We recommend the administration of pre-operative single dose
antibiotic prophylaxis for emergency caesarean as this intervention proved to be 
not equivalent to multiple doses antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing surgical site
infection. Single dose therapy also reduces staff workload along with medication 
costs.

School of Public Health and Social Sciences, Behavioural Sciences Department,
Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, P,O, Box 65015, Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. ihmosha@yahoo.co.uk

BACKGROUND: Contraceptive use is low in developing countries which are still
largely driven by male dominated culture and patriarchal values. This study
explored family planning (FP) decisions, perceptions and gender dynamics among
couples in Mwanza region of Tanzania.
METHODS: Twelve focus group discussions and six in-depth interviews were used to 
collect information from married or cohabiting males and females aged 18-49. The 
participants were purposively selected. Qualitative methods were used to explore 
family planning decisions, perceptions and gender dynamics among couples. A guide
with questions related to family planning perceptions, decisions and gender
dynamics was used. The discussions and interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed
verbatim and analyzed manually and subjected to content analysis.
RESULTS: Four themes emerged during the study. First, "risks and costs" which
refer to the side effects of FP methods and the treatment of side -effects as
well as the costs inherit in being labeled as an unfaithful spouse. Second, "male
involvement" as men showed little interest in participating in family planning
issues. However, the same men were mentioned as key decision-makers even on the
number of children a couple should have and the child spacing of these children. 
Third, "gender relations and communication" as participants indicated that few
women participated in decision-making on family planning and the number of
children to have. Fourth, "urban-rural differences", life in rural favoring
having more children than urban areas therefore, the value of children depended
on the place of residence.
CONCLUSION: Family Planning programs should adapt the promotion of communication 
as well as joint decision-making on FP among couples as a strategy aimed at
enhancing FP use.

Effect of multivitamin supplementation on measles vaccine response among
HIV-exposed uninfected Tanzanian infants.

Sudfeld CR, Duggan C, Histed A, Manji KP, Meydani SN, Aboud S, Wang M,
Giovannucci EL, Fawzi WW.

Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.

Immunization and nutritional interventions are mainstays of child health programs
in sub-Saharan Africa, yet few published data exist on their interactions.
HIV-exposed (but uninfected) infants enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled 
trial of multivitamin supplements (vitamins B complex, C, and E) conducted in
Tanzania were sampled for an assessment of measles IgG quantity and avidity at 15
to 18 months. Infants were vaccinated between 8.5 and 12 months of age, and all
mothers received high-dose multivitamins as the standard of care. Of 201
HIV-exposed infants who were enrolled, 138 (68.7%) were seropositive for measles.
There were no effects of infant multivitamin supplementation on measles
seroconversion proportions, IgG concentrations, or IgG avidity (P > 0.05). The
measles seroconversion proportion was greater for HIV-exposed infants vaccinated 
at 10 to 11 months of age than for those vaccinated at 8.5 to 10 months (P =
0.032) and greater for infants whose mothers had a CD4 T-cell count of <200
cells/Î¼l than for infants whose mothers had a CD4 T-cell count of >350 cells/Î¼l
(P = 0.039). Stunted infants had a significantly decreased IgG quantity compared 
to nonstunted infants (P = 0.012). As for measles avidity, HIV-exposed infants
vaccinated at 10 to 11 months had increased antibody avidity compared to those
vaccinated at 8.5 to 10 months (P = 0.031). Maternal CD4 T-cell counts of <200
cells/Î¼l were associated with decreased avidity compared to counts of >350
cells/Î¼l (P = 0.047), as were lower infant height-for-age z-scores (P = 0.016).
Supplementation with multivitamins containing B complex, C, and E does not appear
to improve measles vaccine responses for HIV-exposed infants. Studies are needed 
to better characterize the impact of maternal HIV disease severity on the immune 
system development of HIV-exposed infants and the effect of malnutrition
interventions on vaccine responses. (This study has been registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT00197730.).

Termite fishing by wild chimpanzees: new data from Ugalla, western Tanzania.

Stewart FA, Piel AK.

Division of Biological Anthropology, University of Cambridge, Pembroke Street,
Cambridge, CB2 3QG, UK, fas31@cam.ac.uk.

Chimpanzees manufacture flexible fishing probes to fish for termites in Issa,
Ugalla, western Tanzania. These termite-fishing tools are similar in size and
material to those used by long-studied communities of chimpanzees in western
Tanzania (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and in West Africa (P.Â t.Â verus), but
not central African populations (P.Â t.Â troglodytes). This report adds to the
patchwork of evidence of termite-fishing tool use behaviour by chimpanzees across
Africa.

Comparison of bioavailability between the most available generic tablet
formulation containing artemether and lumefantrine on the Tanzanian market and
the innovator's product.

Minzi OM, Marealle IA, Shekalaghe S, Juma O, Ngaimisi E, Chemba M, Rutaihwa M,
Abdulla S, Sasi P.

BACKGROUND: Existence of anti-malarial generic drugs with low bioavailability
marketed on sub-Saharan Africa has raised a concern on patients achieving
therapeutic concentrations after intake of these products. This work compared
bioavailability of one generic tablet formulation with innovator's product. Both 
were fixed dose combination tablet formulations containing artemether and
lumefantrine.MethodologyThe study was conducted in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, in
which a survey of the most abundant generic containing artemether-lumefantrine
tablet formulation was carried out in retail pharmacies. The most widely
available generic (Artefan(R), Ajanta Pharma Ltd, Maharashtra, India) was sampled
for bioavailability comparison with Coartem(R) (Novartis Pharma, Basel,
Switzerland) - the innovator's product. A randomized, two-treatment cross-over
study was conducted in 18 healthy Tanzanian black male volunteers. Each volunteer
received Artefan(R) (test) and Coartem(R) (as reference) formulation separated by
42 days of drug-free washout period. Serial blood samples were collected up to
168 hours after oral administration of a single dose of each treatment.
Quantitation of lumefantrine plasma levels was done using HPLC with UV detection.
Bioequivalence of the two products was assessed in accordance with the US Food
and Drug Authority (FDA) guidelines. RESULTS: The most widely available generic
in pharmacies was Artefan(R) from India. All eighteen enrolled volunteers
completed the study and both test and reference tablet formulations were well
tolerated. It was possible to quantify lumefantrine alone, therefore, the
pharmacokinetic parameters reported herein are for lumefantrine. The geometric
mean ratios for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-[infinity] were 84% in all cases and within
FDA recommended bioequivalence limits of 80% -- 125%, but the 90% confidence
intervals were outside FDA recommended limits (CI 49--143%, 53 - 137%, 52 - 135% 
respectively). There were no statistical significant differences between the two 
formulations with regard to PK parameters (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although the
ratios of AUCs and Cmax were within the acceptable FDA range, bioequivalence
between Artefan(R) and Coartem(R) tablet formulations was not demonstrated due to
failure to comply with the FDA 90 % confidence interval criteria. Based on the
observed total drug exposure (AUCs), Artefan(R) is likely to produce a similar
therapeutic response as Coartem(R).

Two new species of zooplanktivorous haplochromine cichlids from Lake Victoria,
Tanzania.

de Zeeuw MP, Westbroek I, van Oijen MJ, Witte F.

Naturalis Biodiversity Center, The Netherlands.

Two new species of zooplanktivorous haplochromine cichlids from Lake Victoria,
Tanzania, are described and illustrated. These species closely resemble each
other. Their affinities to other zooplanktivorous haplochromines from Lake
Victoria are discussed. Haplochromis argens sp. n., which featured under
nicknames (mainly Haplochromis "argens") in more than 50 papers, was caught both 
in the Mwanza Gulf and the Emin Pasha Gulf, whereas Haplochromis goldschmidti sp.
n. was only found in the Emin Pasha Gulf. Of the latter species only males are
available, but it seems unlikely that it represents a case of male colour
polymorphism as several presumably unrelated characters differ in sympatry
between the two species, suggesting that there is no gene flow. Statistical
analysis revealed that the overall difference between the two species is greater 
than that between the populations from the two locations. Body depth of the two
species in sympatry in the Emin Pasha Gulf was more similar than that of
Haplochromis goldschmidti sp. n. and the allopatric population of Haplochromis
argens sp. n. from the Mwanza Gulf,which mayindicate an overall environmental
effect. However, several measurements related to the width of snout and mouth
differed more between the populations of the two species in sympatry than between
the allopatric populations. In contrast to a group of zooplanktivorous species
that recovered successfully after environmental changes in the lake, Haplochromis
argens sp. n. is among a group that became extremely rare and probably is in
danger of extinction; the conservation status of Haplochromis goldschmidti sp. n.
is currently unknown.

Department of Health Policy and Management, Gillings School of Global Public
Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.

Cancer burden is increasing in Africa more than in any other continent, but
population-based tracking of cancer incidence is incomplete. Cancer registries
can improve understanding of cancer incidence. To assess organizational readiness
to sustain registry development, we conducted a survey assessing change efficacy,
resource availability and change commitment at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical 
Centre (KCMC), an academic hospital in Moshi, Tanzania. Fifty-two surveys were
returned (80% response rate). There was strong reliability among change efficacy 
and commitment survey items, with Cronbach's alphas of 0.93 and 0.77,
respectively. Clinicians, nurses and administrators conveyed similar responses
regarding change efficacy. Clinicians had similar responses for change
commitment. Echoing opinion in many low- and middle-income countries,
approximately one-third of respondents indicated there were no funds to maintain 
the registry, and funds were not obtainable. For most resources, respondents felt
that resources were sufficient or attainable. Respondents were generally
confident and committed to registry implementation. Lessons learned at KCMC may
be more broadly relevant.

Estimating the Number of People Who Inject Drugs, Female Sex Workers, and Men Who
Have Sex with Men, Unguja Island, Zanzibar: Results and Synthesis of Multiple
Methods.

To determine the number of people who inject drugs (PWID), female sex workers
(FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) living in Unguja Island, Zanzibar in
2011/2012, we applied several, practical population size estimation methods
including literature review, unique object multiplier, recapture from the 2007
survey, wisdom of the crowds and service multiplier. We synthesized findings and 
presented them to a panel of experts in order to determine plausible estimates
for each population. The estimates adopted by a panel of experts as being most
plausible were 3,000 for PWID, 3,958 for FSW and 2,157 for MSM. We learned that
no one method could be concluded to be the standard for all three populations.
The estimates we found, though still not perfect, are useful for the HIV
programmes serving these populations.

Schistosomiasis and urinary bladder cancer in North Western Tanzania: a
retrospective review of 185 patients.

Rambau PF, Chalya PL, Jackson K.

Department of Pathology, Catholic University of Health and Allied
Sciences-Bugando (CUHAS-Bugando), Box 1464, Mwanza, Tanzania.
prambau@bugando.ac.tz.

INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, cancers of the urinary bladder are well known to be
associated with environmental chemical carcinogens such as smoking and
occupational exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These cancers are
typically transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial carcinoma). In areas where
schistosomiasis is endemic there is a high incidence of squamous cell carcinoma
of the urinary bladder. Schistosomiasis causes chronic granulomatous cystitis
leading to squamous metaplasia of transitional epithelium, and subsequently
development of squamous cell carcinoma. The western part of Tanzania on the
shores of Lake Victoria is such an endemic area. This study was done to document 
the burden of urinary bladder cancer associated with schistosomiasis in this
region.
METHODS: This was a descriptive retrospective study of histologically confirmed
cases of urinary bladder cancer seen at the Department of Pathology Bugando
Medical Centre (BMC) over a period of 10 years. Data were retrieved from the
records of the Departments of Pathology, Medical Records and Surgery. Data were
analyzed by the use of contingency tables.
RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were diagnosed with cancer of the urinary
bladder during the study period, where as 90 (48.6%) were males and 95 (51.4)
were females. The mean age at diagnosis was 54.3 years. Squamous cell carcinoma
was the most frequent histological type (55.1%), followed by conventional
transitional cell carcinoma (40.5%). Eighty three of all cancer cases (44.9%)
were found to have schistosomal eggs. Schistosomiasis was commonly associated
with squamous cancers compared to non squamous cancers. Most of the cancers
associated with schistosomiasis had invaded the muscularis propria of the urinary
bladder at the time of diagnosis (p<0.001) and such cancers were frequent below
50 years of age with a significant statistical difference (p<0.001). Poorly
differentiated tumors were more frequent in females than males with a significant
statistical difference (p=0.006).
CONCLUSION: The majority of urinary bladder cancers seen in the Lake Region were 
squamous cell carcinoma associated with schistosomiasis. These cancers showed an 
aggressive behavior and were commonly seen in the younger age groups. Effective
control of schistosomiasis in this region should significantly reduce the burden 
of urinary bladder cancer.

The prevalence of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection based on an
interferon-Î³ release assay: a cross-sectional survey among urban adults in
Mwanza, Tanzania.

INTRODUCTION: One third of the world's population is estimated to be latently
infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (LTBI). Surveys of LTBI are rarely
performed in resource poor TB high endemic countries like Tanzania although
low-income countries harbor the largest burden of the worlds LTBI. The primary
objective was to estimate the prevalence of LTBI in household contacts of
pulmonary TB cases and a group of apparently healthy neighborhood controls in an 
urban setting of such a country. Secondly we assessed potential impact of LTBI on
inflammation by quantitating circulating levels of an acute phase reactant:
alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in neighborhood controls.
METHODS: The study was nested within the framework of two nutrition studies among
TB patients in Mwanza, Tanzania. Household contacts- and neighborhood controls
were invited to participate. The study involved a questionnaire, BMI
determination and blood samples to measure AGP, HIV testing and a Quantiferon
Gold In tube (QFN-IT) test to detect signs of LTBI.
RESULTS: 245 household contacts and 192 neighborhood controls had available
QFN-IT data. Among household contacts, the proportion of QFT-IT positive was 59% 
compared to 41% in the neighborhood controls (pâ€Š=â€Š0.001). In a linear regression 
model adjusted for sex, age, CD4 and HIV, a QFT-IT positive test was associated
with a 10% higher level of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein(AGP) (10(B) 1.10, 95% CI
1.01; 1.20, pâ€Š=â€Š0.03), compared to individuals with a QFT-IT negative test.
CONCLUSION: LTBI is highly prevalent among apparently healthy urban Tanzanians
even without known exposure to TB in the household. LTBI was found to be
associated with elevated levels of AGP. The implications of this observation
merit further studies.

Low hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) is common in Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) and
associated with complications including stroke, although determinants remain
unknown. We investigated potential hematological, genetic, and nutritional
predictors of daytime SpO2 in Tanzanian children with SCA and compared them with 
non-SCA controls. Steady-state resting pulse oximetry, full blood count,
transferrin saturation, and clinical chemistry were measured. Median daytime SpO2
was 97% (IQ range 94-99%) in SCA (N = 458), lower (P < 0.0001) than non-SCA
(median 99%, IQ range 98-100%; N = 394). Within SCA, associations with SpO2 were 
observed for hematological variables, transferrin saturation, body-mass-index
z-score, hemoglobin F (HbF%), genotypes, and hemolytic markers; mean cell
hemoglobin (MCH) explained most variability (P < 0.001, Adj r (2) = 0.09). In
non-SCA only age correlated with SpO2. Î±-thalassemia 3.7 deletion highly
correlated with decreased MCH (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.60, P <
0.0001). In multivariable models, lower SpO2 correlated with higher MCH
(Î²-coefficient -0.32, P < 0.001) or with decreased copies of Î±-thalassemia 3.7
deletion (Î²-coefficient 1.1, P < 0.001), and independently in both models with
lower HbF% (Î²-coefficient 0.15, P < 0.001) and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase 
genotype (Î²-coefficient -1.12, P = 0.012). This study provides evidence to
support the hypothesis that effects on red cell rheology are important in
determining SpO2 in children with SCA. Potential mechanisms and implications are 
discussed.

Comparison of the effects of extracts from three Vitex plant species on Anopheles
gambiae s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae.

Acetone and methanol extracts of different parts of three Vitex species (leaves
and stem bark of Vitex trifolia, leaves, stem bark and root bark of Vitex
schiliebenii and stem and root bark of Vitex payos) were evaluated for their
potential to control Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. larvae (Diptera: Culicidae).
The extracts gave different levels and rate of mortality of the larvae. Some
(methanol extract of V. trifolia leaves, acetone extracts of stem bark and leaves
of V. schiliebenii, acetone extract of root bark of V. payos) caused 100%
mortality at 100 ppm in 72 h, with those of V. schiliebenii and V. payos showing 
faster rate of mortality (LTâ‚…â‚€=8 h) than that of V. trifolia (LTâ‚…â‚€=14 h). At
lower doses of these extracts (â‰¤50 ppm), most of the larvae failed to transform
to normal pupae but gave larval-pupal intermediates between 4 and 14 days of
exposure. Some pupated normally but the adults that emerged appeared to be weak
and died within 48 h. Extracts of the stem bark of V. payos showed interesting
effects on the larvae. Initially, the larvae were relatively hyperactive compared
to those in control treatments. Later, the ones that did not transform to
larval-pupal intermediates became stretched and inactive and died and floated in 
clusters on the surface. These observations suggest some interesting
growth-disrupting constituents in the plants, with possible application in the
practical control of mosquito larvae in aquatic ecosystems.

Regular treatments of praziquantel do not impact on the genetic make-up of
Schistosoma mansoni in Northern Senegal.

The Senegal River Basin (SRB) experienced a major epidemic of intestinal
schistosomiasis in the early nineties, after the construction of a dam for
irrigation purposes. Exceptionally low cure rates following praziquantel (PZQ)
treatment at the onset of the epidemic raised concerns about PZQ resistant
strains of Schistosoma mansoni, although they could also be attributed to the
intense transmission at that time. A field study in the same region more than 15 
years later found cure rates for S. mansoni still to be low, whereas
Schistosomahaematobium responded well to treatment. We collected S. mansoni
miracidia from children at base-line prior to treatment, six months after two PZQ
treatments and two years after the start of the study when they had received a
total of five PZQ treatments. In total, 434 miracidia from 12 children were
successfully genotyped with at least six out of nine DNA microsatellite loci. We 
found no significant differences in the genetic diversity of, and genetic
differentiation between parasite populations before and after repeated treatment,
suggesting that PZQ treatment does not have an impact on the neutral evolution of
the parasite. This is in stark contrast with a similar study in Tanzania where a 
significant decrease in genetic diversity was observed in S. mansoni miracidia
after a single round of PZQ treatment. We argue that PZQ resistance might play a 
role in our study area, although rapid re-infection cannot be excluded. It is
important to monitor this situation carefully and conduct larger field studies
with short-term follow-up after treatment. Since PZQ is the only general
schistosomicide available, the possibility of PZQ resistance is of great concern 
both for disease control and for curative use in clinical practice.

Rights-based services for adolescents living with HIV: adolescent self-efficacy
and implications for health systems in Zambia.

A rights-based approach in HIV service delivery for adults is increasingly taking
root in sub-Saharan Africa in the context of greater availability of
antiretroviral therapy. Yet there has been comparatively little progress in
strengthening a rights-based approach to adolescent HIV services, which we
learned during a qualitative study in 2010 among 111 adolescents living with HIV,
21 parents and 38 health providers in three districts in Zambia. Adolescents in
the study expressed a range of information and support needs and wanted locally
relevant interventions to meet those needs. They wanted greater access to HIV,
sexual and reproductive health information, information on how to protect
themselves, privacy and confidentiality in service sites, skills training so as
to be able to earn money, and better control over disclosure of their HIV status 
to others. Both health workers and parents acknowledged that information and
services needed to be improved to meet those needs far better. This paper
provides examples of successful programmes in Zimbabwe, Uganda, Tanzania,
Botswana and South Africa and calls for adolescent services to be linked to both 
paediatric and adult services, peer networks to be established to increase
adolescents' ability to collectively voice their concerns and support each other,
interventions supporting adolescents' control over self-disclosure, and lastly
that adolescent health should become a training specialty in sub-Saharan Africa.

Gendered norms, sexual exploitation and adolescent pregnancy in rural Tanzania.

Adolescent pregnancy places girls at increased risk for poor health and
educational outcomes that limit livelihood options, economic independence, and
empowerment in adulthood. In Tanzania, adolescent pregnancy remains a significant
concern, with over half of all first births occurring before women reach the age 
of 20. A participatory research and action project (Vitu Newala) conducted
formative research in a rural district on the dynamics of sexual risk and agency 
among 82 girls aged 12-17. Four major risk factors undermined girls' ability to
protect their own health and well-being: poverty that pushed them into having sex
to meet basic needs, sexual expectations on the part of older men and boys their 
age, rape and coercive sex (including sexual abuse from an early age), and
unintended pregnancy. Transactional sex with older men was one of the few
available sources of income that allowed adolescent girls to meet their basic
needs, making this a common choice for many girls, even though it increased the
risk of unintended (early) pregnancy. Yet parents and adult community members
blamed the girls alone for putting themselves at risk. These findings were used
to inform a pilot project aimed to engage and empower adolescent girls and boys
as agents of change to influence powerful gender norms that perpetuate girls'
risk.

"I have grown up controlling myself a lot." Fear and misconceptions about sex
among adolescents vertically-infected with HIV in Tanzania.

Joanna.Busza@lshtm.ac.uk

With increased access to HIV treatment throughout Africa, a generation of HIV
positive children is now transitioning to adulthood while living with a chronic
condition requiring lifelong medication, which can amplify the anxieties of
adolescence. This qualitative study explored how adolescents in Tanzania with HIV
experience their nascent sexuality, as part of an evaluation of a home-based care
programme. We interviewed 14 adolescents aged 15-19 who had acquired HIV
perinatally, 10 of their parents or other primary caregivers, and 12 volunteer
home-based care providers who provided support, practical advice, and referrals
to clinical services. Adolescents expressed unease about their sexuality, fearing
that sex and relationships were inappropriate and hazardous, given their HIV
status. They worried about having to disclose their status to partners, the risks
of infecting others and for their own health. Thus, many anticipated postponing
or avoiding sex indefinitely. Caregivers and home-based care providers reinforced
negative views of sexual activity, partly due to prevailing misconceptions about 
the harmful effects of sex with HIV. The adolescents had restricted access to
accurate information, appropriate guidance, or comprehensive reproductive health 
services and were likely to experience significant unmet need as they initiated
sexual relationships. Care programmes could help to reduce this gap by
facilitating open communication about sexuality between adolescents and their
caregivers, providers, and HIV-positive peers.

Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is commonly termed the 'amphibian chytrid
fungus' but thus far has been documented to be a pathogen of only batrachian
amphibians (anurans and caudatans). It is not proven to infect the limbless,
generally poorly known, and mostly soil-dwelling caecilians (Gymnophiona). We
conducted the largest qPCR survey of Bd in caecilians to date, for more than 200 
field-swabbed specimens from five countries in Africa and South America,
representing nearly 20 species, 12 genera, and 8 families. Positive results were 
recovered for 58 specimens from Tanzania and Cameroon (4 families, 6 genera, 6+
species). Quantities of Bd were not exceptionally high, with genomic equivalent
(GE) values of 0.052-17.339. In addition, we report the first evidence of lethal 
chytridiomycosis in caecilians. Mortality in captive (wild-caught, commercial pet
trade) Geotrypetes seraphini was associated with GE scores similar to those we
detected for field-swabbed, wild animals.

Palaeontological evidence for an Oligocene divergence between Old World monkeys
and apes.

Apes and Old World monkeys are prominent components of modern African and Asian
ecosystems, yet the earliest phases of their evolutionary history have remained
largely undocumented. The absence of crown catarrhine fossils older than
âˆ¼20â€‰million years (Myr) has stood in stark contrast to molecular divergence
estimates of âˆ¼25-30â€‰Myr for the split between Cercopithecoidea (Old World
monkeys) and Hominoidea (apes), implying long ghost lineages for both clades.
Here we describe the oldest known fossil 'ape', represented by a partial mandible
preserving dental features that place it with 'nyanzapithecine' stem hominoids.
Additionally, we report the oldest stem member of the Old World monkey clade,
represented by a lower third molar. Both specimens were recovered from a
precisely dated 25.2-Myr-old stratum in the Rukwa Rift, a segment of the western 
branch of the East African Rift in Tanzania. These finds extend the fossil record
of apes and Old World monkeys well into the Oligocene epoch of Africa, suggesting
a possible link between diversification of crown catarrhines and changes in the
African landscape brought about by previously unrecognized tectonic activity in
the East African rift system.

SETTING: Kibong'oto National Tuberculosis Hospital (KNTH), Kilimanjaro, Tanzania.
OBJECTIVE: Characterize the diagnostic process and interim treatment outcomes
from patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Tanzania.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed among all patients treated at 
KNTH for pulmonary MDR-TB between November 2009 and September 2011.
RESULTS: Sixty-one culture-positive MDR-TB patients initiated therapy, 60 (98%)
with a prior history of TB treatment. Forty-one (67%) were male and 9 (14%) were 
HIV infected with a mean CD4 count of 424 (Â±106) cells/Âµl. The median time from
specimen collection to MDR-TB diagnosis and from diagnosis to initiation of
MDR-TB treatment was 138 days (IQR 101-159) and 131 days (IQR 32-233),
respectively. Following treatment initiation four (7%) patients died (all HIV
negative), 3 (5%) defaulted, and the remaining 54 (89%) completed the intensive
phase. Most adverse drug reactions were mild to moderate and did not require
discontinuation of treatment. Median time to culture conversion was 2 months (IQR
1-3) and did not vary by HIV status. In 28 isolates available for additional
second-line drug susceptibility testing, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside and
para-aminosalicylic acid resistance was rare yet ethionamide resistance was
present in 9 (32%).
CONCLUSION: The majority of MDR-TB patients from this cohort had survived a
prolonged referral process, had multiple episodes of prior TB treatment, but did 
not have advanced AIDS and converted to culture negative early while completing
an intensive inpatient regimen without serious adverse event. Further study is
required to determine the clinical impact of second-line drug susceptibility
testing and the feasibility of alternatives to prolonged hospitalization.

Developmental defects of enamel in primary teeth and association with early life 
course events: a study of 6-36 month old children in Manyara, Tanzania.

Masumo R, BÃ¥rdsen A, AstrÃ¸m AN.

Department of Clinical Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.

BACKGROUND: Children with low birth weight show an increased prevalence of
developmental defects of enamel in the primary dentition that subsequently may
predispose to early childhood caries (ECC).Focusing 6-36 months old, the purpose 
of this study was to assess the frequency of enamel defects in the primary
dentition and identify influences of early life course factors;
socio-demographics, birth weight, child's early illness episodes and mothers'
perceived size of the child at birth, whilst controlling for more recent life
course events in terms of current breastfeeding and oral hygiene.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the high fluoride area of
Manyara, northern Tanzania including 1221 child-mother pairs who attended
Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) clinics for immunization and/or growth
monitoring. After the primary caregivers had completed face to face interviews at
the health care facility, children underwent oral clinical examination whereby
ECC and developmental defects of enamel were recorded using field criteria. All
erupted teeth were examined and the enamel defects were assessed on buccal
surfaces according to the modified DDE Index.
RESULTS: The prevalence of enamel defects was 33.3%. Diffuse opacities were the
most common defects identified (23.1%), followed by hypoplasia (7.6%) and
demarcated opacities (5.0%). The most frequently affected teeth were the upper
central incisors (29.0% - 30.5%), whereas lower central incisors (4.3% to 4.5%)
were least frequently affected. Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusting 
for confounding the factors revealed that having normal birth weight (equal or
more than 2500 g) associated with lower odds of having enamel hypoplasia [OR 0.2 
(95% CI 0.1-0.7)]. No statistically significant association occurred between
birth weight and diffuse opacities, demarcated opacities or combined DDE.
CONCLUSION: Children with the history of low birth weight were more likely than
their normal birth weight counterparts to present with enamel hypoplasia. In view
of the frequent occurrence of enamel defects and the fact that hypoplasia may
constitute a risk factor for future ECC, enamel defects should be included as a
dental health indicator in epidemiological studies of children in northern
Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE:: To assess the non-inferiority of a task-shifting HIV treatment model 
relying on peer counselors and nurses compared to a physician-centered model
among HIV-1 positive women initiated on Antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a PMTCT
clinic in Mulago Hospital, Uganda. METHODS:: HIV-1 infected ART eligible naÃ¯ve
women were randomized to either nurse-peer (intervention) or doctor-counselor
(standard model) arm. The primary endpoint was virologic success defined
attaining a viral load [VL] <400 RNA copies/ml 6-12 months after ART initiation. 
Non-inferiority was defined as the lower 95% confidence limit for the difference 
in proportions with virologic success being less than 10%.Secondary outcomes
included immunological success (mean CD4 count increase from baseline), and pill 
count. RESULTS:: Data on 85 participants were analyzed (n=45 in the intervention 
and n=40 in the standard model). The proportion of participants with virologic
success was similar in the standard and intervention models (91% versus 88%
respectively; difference 3%, 95% CI: -11 to 12%). Probability of viral detection 
at 6-12 months' time point was similar in the two models (log rank test p-value =
0.73). Immunologic and pill count indicators were also similar in the
intervention and standard models, with mean CD4 increase of 217 versus 206
cells/Î¼L (difference 11; 95% CI: -60 to 82 cells/Î¼L), and pill counts of 99.8%
versus 99.7% (difference 0.0; 95% CI: -5 to 5%) respectively. CONCLUSION:: Nurses
and peer counselors were not inferior in providing ART follow-up care to
postpartum women, an approach may help deliver treatment to many more HIV
infected people.

Desirability for a typhoid fever vaccine among rural residents, Pemba Island,
Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Surveillance data indicate that Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi
(S. Typhi) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa. With
limited anticipated short-term improvements in sanitation and water
infrastructure, targeted vaccination campaigns may be an important prevention
tool for typhoid fever.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 435 randomly selected
households in four rural villages on Pemba Island, Tanzania. A dichotomous
'readiness to pay' variable was created to assess vaccine desirability. Data
analyses included univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics and binary
logistic regression. Bivariate outcomes (ANOVA, t-tests, and chi-square) and odds
ratios with 95% confidence intervals are reported.
RESULTS: A total of 66% respondents stated that they would pay for a typhoid
fever vaccine in the future. Readiness to pay was not significantly associated
with household expenditures. Readiness to pay was associated with use of local
Primary Health Care Units (PHCUs) compared to use of cottage or district
hospitals (OR 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.7]: p=.007) and with knowledge of someone being 
sick from typhoid fever (OR 2.2 [95% CI, 1.0-4.5]: p=.039). Respondents
perceiving prevention measures as more effective (OR 1.0 [95% CI, 1.0-1.2]:
p=.009) were also more likely ready to pay. Preferred methods of communication of
information about a typhoid fever vaccine included broadcasting via microphone
('miking'), radio, and door-to-door visits.
CONCLUSIONS: With rapid increase in numbers of licensed and promising vaccines,
policy makers and health administrators are faced with decisions regarding
allocation of scarce health resources for competing interventions. Community
residents need to be informed about diseases which may not be readily recognized,
diagnosed, and treated. Perceived vulnerability to the disease may increase
likelihood of vaccine desirability. A better local understanding of typhoid fever
is needed for general prevention measures, increasing treatment access, and
future vaccination campaigns.

Over-diagnosis of malaria by microscopy in the Kilombero Valley, Southern
Tanzania: an evaluation of the utility and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic
tests.

BACKGROUND: Early and accurate diagnosis of febrile patients is essential to
treat uncomplicated malaria cases properly, prevent severe malaria, and avert
unnecessary anti-malarial treatments. Improper use of anti-malarials increases
the risk of adverse drug reaction and the evolution of drug/parasite resistance. 
While microscopy is the most common form of malaria diagnosis, concerns over its 
accuracy have prompted the incorporation of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
into many national malaria control programmes.
METHODS: Over a three-month period, a direct comparison between microscopy and
RDTs was made in a rural, private dispensary in the Kilombero Valley, Morogoro
District, southern Tanzania, with the aim of estimating the extent of malaria
over-diagnosis and over-treatment with anti-malarials. The study cohort was made 
up of patients referred by the dispensary's clinician for malaria testing. One
hundred percent of patients approached agreed to participate in this study and
were then tested using both microscopy and RDTs. Using the results from the
comparison of the two tests at this dispensary, the potential cost effectiveness 
of introducing RDTs to a neighbouring public health centre was estimated on the
basis of this centre's past malaria records spanning December 2007 to August
2011.
RESULTS: At the private dispensary, the apparent prevalence of malaria was 78%
based on microscopy whereas the true prevalence, calculated using RDTs as the
gold standard, was estimated at 14%. This discrepancy indicates that when using
microscopy as the sole diagnostic test, malaria is being over-diagnosed by
approximately a factor of five in this setting. At the public clinic, apparent
malaria prevalence based on microscopy was 74%. If similar rates of
over-diagnosis are assumed, 5,285 patients of the 6,769 patients positively
diagnosed with malaria using microscopy were likely given unnecessary
anti-malarials, and their true cause of illness was not addressed. The
introduction of RDTs to the public clinic would be highly cost-efficient, with an
estimated net saving of over 96 USD/month.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with RDTs, microscopy led to almost four out of five
patients being over-diagnosed with malaria in this rural part of Tanzania. A
policy that encompasses both the private and public sectors of health care is
needed to ensure quality diagnostic testing for febrile patients. With estimated 
prevalence at 14%, RDT introduction is recommended given WHO findings that RDTs
are predicted to be cost-effective in prevalence areas of less than 20%. The use 
of RDTs in malaria diagnosis would not only reduce government spending but would 
prove beneficial to ensuring appropriate care and treatment of febrile illness.

Why give birth in health facility? Users' and providers' accounts of poor quality
of birth care in Tanzania.

Mselle LT, Moland KM, Mvungi A, Evjen-Olsen B, Kohi TW.

School of Nursing, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. nakutz@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: In Tanzania, half of all pregnant women access a health facility for 
delivery. The proportion receiving skilled care at birth is even lower. In order 
to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, the government has set out to
increase health facility deliveries by skilled care. The aim of this study was to
describe the weaknesses in the provision of acceptable and adequate quality care 
through the accounts of women who have suffered obstetric fistula, nurse-midwives
at both BEmOC and CEmOC health facilities and local community members.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews involving 16 women affected by obstetric
fistula and five nurse-midwives at maternity wards at both BEmOC and CEmOC health
facilities, and Focus Group Discussions with husbands and community members were 
conducted between October 2008 and February 2010 at Comprehensive Community Based
Rehabilitation in Tanzania and Temeke hospitals in Dar es Salaam, and Mpwapwa
district in Dodoma region.
RESULTS: Health care users and health providers experienced poor quality caring
and working environments in the health facilities. Women in labour lacked
support, experienced neglect, as well as physical and verbal abuse.
Nurse-midwives lacked supportive supervision, supplies and also seemed to lack
motivation.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a consensus among women who have suffered serious birth
injuries and nurse midwives staffing both BEmOC and CEmOC maternity wards that
the quality of care offered to women in birth was inadequate. While the birth
accounts of women pointed to failure of care, the nurses described a situation of
disempowerment. The bad birth care experiences of women undermine the reputation 
of the health care system, lower community expectations of facility birth, and
sustain high rates of home deliveries. The only way to increase the rate of
skilled attendance at birth in the current Tanzanian context is to make facility 
birth a safer alternative than home birth. The findings from this study indicate 
that there is a long way to go.

Leptospirosis and human immunodeficiency virus co-infection among febrile
inpatients in northern Tanzania.

Biggs HM, Galloway RL, Bui DM, Morrissey AB, Maro VP, Crump JA.

Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical 
Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.

BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are
prevalent in many areas, including northern Tanzania, yet little is known about
their interaction.
METHODS: We enrolled febrile inpatients at two hospitals in Moshi, Tanzania, over
1 year and performed HIV antibody testing and the microscopic agglutination test 
(MAT) for leptospirosis. Confirmed leptospirosis was defined as â‰¥ four-fold rise 
in MAT titer between acute and convalescent serum samples, and probable
leptospirosis was defined as any reciprocal MAT titer â‰¥ 800.
RESULTS: Confirmed or probable leptospirosis was found in 70 (8.4%) of 831
participants with at least one serum sample tested. At total of 823 (99.0%) of
831 participants had HIV testing performed, and 203 (24.7%) were HIV infected.
Among HIV-infected participants, 9 (4.4%) of 203 had confirmed or probable
leptospirosis, whereas among HIV-uninfected participants 61 (9.8%) of 620 had
leptospirosis. Leptospirosis was less prevalent among HIV-infected as compared to
HIV-uninfected participants [odds ratio (OR) 0.43, p=0.019]. Among those with
leptospirosis, HIV-infected patients more commonly presented with features of
severe sepsis syndrome than HIV-uninfected patients, but differences were not
statistically significant. Among HIV-infected patients, severe immunosuppression 
was not significantly different between those with and without leptospirosis
(p=0.476). Among HIV-infected adolescents and adults, median CD4 percent and
median CD4 count were higher among those with leptospirosis as compared to those 
with other etiologies of febrile illness, but differences in CD4 count did not
reach statistical significance (p=0.015 and p=0.089, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Among febrile inpatients in northern Tanzania, leptospirosis was not
more prevalent among HIV-infected patients. Although some indicators of
leptospirosis severity were more common among HIV-infected patients, a
statistically significant difference was not demonstrated. Among HIV-infected
patients, those with leptospirosis were not more immunosuppressed relative to
those with other etiologies of febrile illness.

Bacteremia and resistant gram-negative pathogens among under-fives in Tanzania.

Christopher A, Mshana SE, Kidenya BR, Hokororo A, Morona D.

BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious public health
concerns worldwide and is increasing at an alarming rate, making daily treatment 
decisions more challenging. This study is aimed at identifying local bacterial
isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to avoid irrational
antibiotic use, especially in settings where unguided management occurs and
febrile illnesses are predominant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A hospital-based
prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2011 to February
2012. Febrile children were serially recruited and demographic and clinical data 
were collected using a standardized data collection tool. A blood culture was
performed and identification of the isolates was undertaken using in-house
biochemical tests. Susceptibility to common antibiotics was investigated using
the disc diffusion methods. RESULTS: Of the 1081 children admitted during the
study period, 317 (29.3%) met the inclusion criteria and were recruited, of whom 
195 (61.5%) and 122 (38.5%) were male and female respectively. The median age was
18 months with an interquartile range of 9 to 36 months. Of the 317 children, 251
(79.2%) were below or equal to 36 months of age. The prevalence of bacteremia was
6.6%. A higher prevalence of bacteraemia was observed in children below 36 months
than in those >= 36 months (7.5% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.001). Predictors of bacteraemia 
were an axillary temperature of >38.5 [degree sign]C (OR =7, 95% CI = 2.2 - 14.8,
p-value = 0.0001), a positive malaria slide (OR =5, 95% CI = 3.0 - 21.2, p-value 
= 0.0001) and a high neutrophils' count (OR =21 95% CI = 5.6 - 84, p-value =
0.0001). Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 7 (33.3%) and 6
(28.6%) of all the isolates respectively. Others gram-negatives bacteria were
Citrobacter spp 2 (9.5%), Enterobacter spp 1 (4.25%), Pseudomonas spp 2 (9.5%),
Proteus spp 1 (4.25%) and Salmonella spp 1 (4.25%). These isolates were highly
resistant to ampicillin (95%), co-trimoxazole (90%), tetracycline (90%),
gentamicin (80%), augmentin (80%), chloramphenicol (65%), ceftriaxone (35%),
cefotaxime (35%) ciprofloxacin (30%), amikacin (30%), ceftazidime (25%) and
norfloxacine (10%). CONCLUSION: Multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria are the
commonest cause of bacteremia in under-fives attending the Bugando Medical
Centre, Mwanza, Tanzania. A high body temperature, a positive malaria slide and a
high absolute neutrophils' count were all independent risk factors found to
predict bacteremia. A higher mortality rate was observed in children with
bacteraemia. Continuous epidemiological surveillance should be conducted so that 
a proper and effective antibiotics management can be instituted, especially in
children with a high grade fever, a positive malaria slide and a high
neutrophils' count.

Increasing caesarean section rates among low-risk groups: a panel study
classifying deliveries according to Robson at a university hospital in Tanzania.

Litorp H, Kidanto HL, Nystrom L, Darj E, EssÃ©n B.

Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, 751 85, Uppsala,
Sweden. helena.litorp@kbh.uu.se

BACKGROUND: Rising caesarean section (CS) rates have been observed worldwide in
recent decades. This study sought to analyse trends in CS rates and outcomes
among a variety of obstetric groups at a university hospital in a low-income
country.
METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based panel study at Muhimbili National
Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All deliveries between 2000 and 2011 with
gestational ageâ€‰â‰¥â€‰28 weeks were included in the study. The 12 years were divided 
into four periods: 2000 to 2002, 2003 to 2005, 2006 to 2008, and 2009 to 2011.
Main outcome measures included CS rate, relative size of obstetric groups,
contribution to overall CS rate, perinatal mortality ratio, neonatal distress,
and maternal mortality ratio. Time trends were analysed within the ten Robson
groups, based on maternal and obstetric characteristics. We applied the Ï‡2 test
for trend to determine whether changes were statistically significant. Odds
ratios of CS were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression, accounting
for maternal age, referral status, and private healthcare insurance.
RESULTS: We included 137,094 deliveries. The total CS rate rose from 19% to 49%, 
involving nine out of ten groups. Multipara without previous CS with single,
cephalic pregnancies in spontaneous labour had a CS rate of 33% in 2009 to 2011. 
Adjusted analysis explained some of the increase. Perinatal mortality and
neonatal distress decreased in multiple pregnancies (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) and
nullipara with breech pregnancies (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.024). Although not
statistically significant, there was an increase in perinatal mortality
(pâ€‰=â€‰0.381) and neonatal distress (pâ€‰=â€‰0.171) among multipara with single
cephalic pregnancies in spontaneous labour. The maternal mortality ratio
increased from 463/100, 000 live births in 2000 to 2002 to 650/100, 000 live
births in 2009 to 2011 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031).
CONCLUSION: The high CS rate among low-risk groups suggests that many CSs might
have been performed on questionable indications. Such a trend may result in even 
higher CS rates in the future. While CS can improve perinatal outcomes, it does
not necessarily do so if performed routinely in low-risk groups.

Chimpanzee nesting patterns in savanna habitat: environmental influences and
preferences.

Hernandez-Aguilar RA, Moore J, Stanford CB.

Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis, Department of Biosciences,
University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. r.a.hernandez-aguilar@bio.uio.no

Data on chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) nesting patterns were collected in Issa,
Ugalla, western Tanzania. Ugalla is one of the driest, most open, and seasonal
habitats inhabited by chimpanzees. We investigated the physical characteristics
of nests and trees used for nesting to understand environmental influences on
nest building and identify the characteristics preferred by the chimpanzees and
the basis for such preferences. We analyzed 2,167 nests and 1,523 nesting trees. 
Most nests were built in the middle section of the tree crown and close to the
tree trunk, and used a single tree in construction. Some physical characteristics
of nests (e.g., distance from tree trunk) seemed to be the result of constraints 
imposed by tree structure. Issa chimpanzees preferred tall trees with high first 
branches for nesting supporting the hypothesis that elevated height of a sleeping
place is a predator defense strategy. The height from the ground to the first
branch showed less variation than either tree height or crown height and
correlated weakly with tree height, suggesting that height from the ground to the
first branch may be a more important factor than tree height alone in selecting a
tree in which to nest. As in other study sites, the chimpanzees used tree species
in proportions that did not correspond to their abundance suggesting tree species
preference. We report for the first time that chimpanzees directionally oriented 
their nests and propose that this may be to maximize sunlight. We compare our
data to those of other chimpanzee study sites.

Community perceptions on the secondary health benefits established by malaria
vaccine trials (RTS,S phase 2 and phase 3) at the Korogwe site in North Eastern
Tanzania.

Liheluka EA, Lusingu JP, Manongi RN.

National Institute for Medical Research, Tanga Centre, Korogwe site, Tanga,
Tanzania. liheluka@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Studies conducted thus far have demonstrated that the malaria vaccine
(RTS,S) has a promising safety profile. Within the context of planning for future
vaccine trials and for the purpose of building on previous research that has been
undertaken in sub-Saharan Africa with regard to community perceptions about
clinical studies, this research aimed to explore the community perceptions on the
secondary health benefits established by the malaria vaccine trials (RTS,S Phase 
2 and Phase 3) at the Korogwe site in Tanzania.
METHODS: An exploratory qualitative study design was used. Participants were
recruited from the Korogwe site. Sampling techniques were purposive and random. A
total of five focus group discussions and six in-depth interviews were conducted.
Interview guides with open-ended questions were employed to collect data. Male
and female parents whose infants participated and those whose infants did not
participate in the trials, health workers and community leaders were interviewed.
Thematic analysis framework was used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: The activities of a malaria vaccine project appeared to be well known to
the community. Respondents had largely positive views towards the secondary
health benefits which have been established by malaria vaccine trials. The
project has led to a massive investment in health care infrastructure and an
improvement in health care services across the study areas. The project was
perceived by the community to have established major secondary health benefits.
Misconceptions amongst respondents, especially with regard to blood samples, were
also observed in this study.
CONCLUSION: Despite some misconceptions with regard to the conduct of malaria
vaccine trials, especially on blood sampling, generally this study observed that 
most participants were positive about the secondary health benefits brought about
by the malaria vaccine trials in Korogwe.

Access to artemisinin-based anti-malarial treatment and its related factors in
rural Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) has been widely adopted
as one of the main malaria control strategies. However, its promise to save
thousands of lives in sub-Saharan Africa depends on how effective the use of ACT 
is within the routine health system. The INESS platform evaluated effective
coverage of ACT in several African countries. Timely access within 24 hours to an
authorized ACT outlet is one of the determinants of effective coverage and was
assessed for artemether-lumefantrine (Alu), in two district health systems in
rural Tanzania.
METHODS: From October 2009 to June 2011 we conducted continuous rolling household
surveys in the Kilombero-Ulanga and the Rufiji Health and Demographic
Surveillance Sites (HDSS). Surveys were linked to the routine HDSS update rounds.
Members of randomly pre-selected households that had experienced a fever episode 
in the previous two weeks were eligible for a structured interview. Data on
individual treatment seeking, access to treatment, timing, source of treatment
and household costs per episode were collected. Data are presented on timely
access from a total of 2,112 interviews in relation to demographics, seasonality,
and socio economic status.
RESULTS: In Kilombero-Ulanga, 41.8% (CI: 36.6-45.1) and in Rufiji 36.8%
(33.7-40.1) of fever cases had access to an authorized ACT provider within 24
hours of fever onset. In neither of the HDSS site was age, sex, socio-economic
status or seasonality of malaria found to be significantly correlated with timely
access.
CONCLUSION: Timely access to authorized ACT providers is below 50% despite
interventions intended to improve access such as social marketing and
accreditation of private dispensing outlets. To improve prompt diagnosis and
treatment, access remains a major bottle neck and new more innovative
interventions are needed to raise effective coverage of malaria treatment in
Tanzania.

Diabetes is a strong predictor of mortality during tuberculosis treatment: a
prospective cohort study among tuberculosis patients from Mwanza, Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE: Strong evidence suggests diabetes may be associated with tuberculosis 
(TB) and could influence TB treatment outcomes. We assessed the role of diabetes 
on sputum culture conversion and mortality among patients undergoing TB
treatment.
METHODS: A total of 1250 Tanzanian TB patients were followed prospectively during
TB treatment with sputum culture after 2 and 5 months. Survival status was
assessed at least 1 year after initiation of treatment. At baseline, all
participants underwent testing for diabetes and HIV, and the serum concentration 
of the acute phase reactant alpha-1 glycoprotein (AGP) was determined.
RESULTS: There were no differences between participants with and without diabetes
regarding the proportion of positive cultures at 2 (3.8% vs. 5.8%) and 5 (1.3%
vs. 0.9%) months (P > 0.46). However, among patients with a positive TB culture, 
relatively more patients with diabetes died before the 5-month follow-up. Within 
the initial 100 days of TB treatment, diabetes was associated with a fivefold
increased risk of mortality (RR 5.09, 95% CI 2.36; 11.02, P < 0.001) among HIV
uninfected, and a twofold increase among HIV co-infected patient (RR 2.33 95% CI 
1.20; 4.53, P = 0.012), while diabetes was not associated with long-term
mortality. Further adjustment with AGP did not change the estimates.
CONCLUSION: Diabetes considerably increases risk of early mortality during TB
treatment. The effect may not be explained by increased severity of TB, but could
be due to impaired TB treatment response. Research is needed to clarify the
mechanism and to assess whether glycaemic control improves survival.

Reasons for poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy postnatally in HIV-1
infected women treated for their own health: experiences from the Mitra Plus
study in Tanzania.

Ngarina M, Popenoe R, Kilewo C, Biberfeld G, Ekstrom AM.

BACKGROUND: In a study of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV
(PMTCT) by triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (the
Mitra Plus study), retrospective viral load testing revealed a high and
increasing frequency of detectable viral load during follow-up for two years
postnatally in women given continuous ART for their own health suggesting poor
adherence. This study explored women's own perceived barriers to adherence to ART
post-delivery so as to identify ways to facilitate better drug adherence among
women in need of ART for their own health. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews
were conducted with 23 of the 48 women who had detectable viral load at 24 months
postnatally. Content analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Most women
in the study did not acknowledge poor adherence until confronted with the viral
load figures. Then, however, they revealed multiple reasons for failing to
adhere. They said that their motivation to take ART decreased once they had
protected their children from becoming infected and successfully weaned them.
Feeling well for some, and a feeling of hopelessness for others, also decreased
motivation to continue ART. The overwhelming demands of everyday life, poverty
and lack of empowerment also posed significant barriers to long-term adherence.
The need to keep their HIV status a secret and not let anyone see them taking the
drugs was another steep barrier. CONCLUSION: Reasons for postnatal failure to
adhere by mothers put on ART for life during pregnancy included lack of
motivation to continue ART after weaning the child, poverty and stigma. Projects 
that simultaneously address stigma, poverty and women's lack of empowerment may
be necessary for PMTCT and ART to reach their full potential. Our results
indicate that the new WHO proposal to start all HIV-infected pregnant women on
lifelong ART regardless of CD4 cell count needs to address the challenging
realities of women in resource-poor contexts if it is to be successful.

Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Enugu, Nigeria. doctortoniaonyeka@gmail.com

Hospice and palliative care development, in terms of availability and services,
occur to varying degrees in the developing world. In this paper, the evolution of
palliative care practices in four developing nations (Nigeria, Georgia, Ethiopia 
and Tanzania) is described. By highlighting common problems as well as the unique
individual perspectives of each country's practice, this paper aims at increasing
global awareness of palliative care in the developing world. While the call for
palliative care to become a fundamental human right is sustained, it is also
hoped that this article will stimulate a global discussion on the best possible
way to encourage the establishment and growth of palliative care services in
other developing countries where hitherto it has not been in existence, with
policymakers and healthcare professionals taking the lead through the institution
of sound national policies to promote and provide palliative care to all
citizenry.

We investigated the relationship between being bullied and measured body weight
and perceived body weight among adolescents of a middle-income sub Saharan
African country. Our data originated from the Global School-based Health Survey, 
which targets adolescents aged 13-15 years. Student weights and heights were
measured before administrating the questionnaire which included questions about
personal data, health behaviors and being bullied. Standard criteria were used to
assess thinness, overweight and obesity. Among 1,006 participants who had
complete data, 16.5% (95%CI 13.3-20.2) reported being bullied â‰¥ 3 days during the
past 30 days; 13.4% were thin, 16.8% were overweight and 7.6% were obese.
Categories of actual weight and of perceived weight correlated only moderately
(Spearman correlation coefficient 0.37 for boys and 0.57 for girls; p < 0.001).
In univariate analysis, both actual obesity (OR 1.76; p = 0.051) and perception
of high weight (OR 1.63 for "slightly overweight"; OR 2.74 for "very overweight",
both p < 0.05) were associated with being bullied. In multivariate analysis, ORs 
for categories of perceived overweight were virtually unchanged while ORs for
actual overweight and obesity were substantially attenuated, suggesting a
substantial role of perceived weight in the association with being bullied.
Actual underweight and perceived thinness also tended to be associated with being
bullied, although not significantly. Our findings suggest that more research
attention be given to disentangling the significant association between body
image, overweight and bullying among adolescents. Further studies in diverse
populations are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes that bite people outdoors can sustain malaria transmission
even where effective indoor interventions such as bednets or indoor residual
spraying are already widely used. Outdoor tools may therefore complement current 
indoor measures and improve control. We developed and evaluated a prototype
mosquito control device, the 'Mosquito Landing Box' (MLB), which is baited with
human odours and treated with mosquitocidal agents. The findings are used to
explore technical options and challenges relevant to luring and killing
outdoor-biting malaria vectors in endemic settings.
METHODS: Field experiments were conducted in Tanzania to assess if wild
host-seeking mosquitoes 1) visited the MLBs, 2) stayed long or left shortly after
arrival at the device, 3) visited the devices at times when humans were also
outdoors, and 4) could be killed by contaminants applied on the devices. Odours
suctioned from volunteer-occupied tents were also evaluated as a potential
low-cost bait, by comparing baited and unbaited MLBs.
RESULTS: There were significantly more Anopheles arabiensis, An. funestus, Culex 
and Mansonia mosquitoes visiting baited MLB than unbaited controls (Pâ‰¤0.028).
Increasing sampling frequency from every 120 min to 60 and 30 min led to an
increase in vector catches of up to 3.6 fold (Pâ‰¤0.002), indicating that many
mosquitoes visited the device but left shortly afterwards. Outdoor host-seeking
activity of malaria vectors peaked between 7:30 and 10:30 pm, and between 4:30
and 6:00 am, matching durations when locals were also outdoors. Maximum mortality
of mosquitoes visiting MLBs sprayed or painted with formulations of candidate
mosquitocidal agent (pirimiphos-methyl) was 51%. Odours from volunteer occupied
tents attracted significantly more mosquitoes to MLBs than controls (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: While odour-baited devices such as the MLBs clearly have potential
against outdoor-biting mosquitoes in communities where LLINs are used, candidate 
contaminants must be those that are effective at ultra-low doses even after short
contact periods, since important vector species such as An. arabiensis make only 
brief visits to such devices. Natural human odours suctioned from occupied
dwellings could constitute affordable sources of attractants to supplement odour 
baits for the devices. The killing agents used should be environmentally safe,
long lasting, and have different modes of action (other than pyrethroids as used 
on LLINs), to curb the risk of physiological insecticide resistance.

BACKGROUND: With a decline of infant mortality rates, neonatal mortality rates
are striking high in development countries particularly sub Saharan Africa. The
toolkit for high quality neonatal services describes the principle of patient
satisfaction, which we translate as mother's involvement in neonatal care and so 
better outcomes. The aim of the study was to assess mothers' experiences,
perception and satisfaction of neonatal care in the hospitals of Kilimanjaro
region of Tanzania.
METHODS: A cross sectional study using qualitative and quantitative approaches in
112 semi structured interviews from 14 health facilities. Open ended questions
for detection of illness, care given to the baby and time spent by the health
worker for care and treatment were studied. Probing of the responses was used to 
extract and describe findings by a mix of in-depth interview skills. Closed ended
questions for the quantitative variables were used to quantify findings for
statistical use. Narratives from open ended questions were coded by colours in
excel sheet and themes were manually counted.
RESULTS: 80 mothers were interviewed from 13 peripheral facilities and 32 mothers
were interviewed at a zonal referral hospital of Kilimanjaro region. 59 mothers
(73.8%) in the peripheral hospitals of the region noted neonatal problems and
they assisted for attaining diagnosis after a showing a concern for a request for
further investigations. 11 mothers (13.8%) were able to identify the baby's
diagnosis directly without any assistance, followed by 7 mothers (8.7%) who were 
told by a relative, and 3 mothers (3.7%) who were told of the problem by the
doctor that their babies needed medical attention. 24 times mothers in the
peripheral hospitals reported bad language like "I don't have time to listen to
you every day and every time." 77 mothers in the periphery (90.6%) were not
satisfied with the amount of time spent by the doctors in seeing their babies.
CONCLUSION: Mothers of the neonates play great roles in identifying the illness
of the newborn. Mother's awareness of what might be needed during neonatal
support strategies to improve neonatal care in both health facilities and the
communities.

Predictors of HIV serostatus disclosure to partners among HIV-positive pregnant
women in Morogoro, Tanzania.

Kiula ES, Damian DJ, Msuya SE.

BACKGROUND: Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) has been
scaled, to more than 90% of health facilities in Tanzania. Disclosure of HIV
results to partners and their participation is encouraged in the program. This
study aimed to determine the prevalence, patterns and predictors of HIV
sero-status disclosure to partners among HIV positive pregnant women in Morogoro 
municipality, Tanzania. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted in March
to May 2010 among HIV-positive pregnant women who were attending for routine
antenatal care in primary health care facilities of the municipality and had been
tested for HIV at least one month prior to the study. Questionnaires were used to
collect information on possible predictors of HIV disclosure to partners.
RESULTS: A total of 250 HIV-positive pregnant women were enrolled. Forty one
percent (102) had disclosed their HIV sero-status to their partners.
HIV-disclosure to partners was more likely among pregnant women who were < 25
years old [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2--4.1], who knew their HIV
status before the current pregnancy [AOR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.7--8.3], and discussed 
with their partner before testing [AOR = 6.9; 95% CI: 2.4--20.1]. Dependency on
the partner for food/rent/school fees, led to lower odds of disclosure to
partners [AOR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1--0.7]. Nine out of ten women reported to have
been counseled on importance of disclosure and partner participation.
CONCLUSIONS: Six in ten HIV positive pregnant women in this setting had not
disclosed their results of the HIV test to their partners. Empowering pregnant
women to have an individualized HIV-disclosure plan, strengthening of the HIV
provider initiated counseling and testing and addressing economic development,
may be some of the strategies in improving HIV disclosure and partner involvement
in this setting.

Analysing and recommending options for maintaining universal coverage with
long-lasting insecticidal nets: the case of Tanzania in 2011.

Koenker HM, Yukich JO, Mkindi A, Mandike R, Brown N, Kilian A, Lengeler C.

Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Communication
Programs, Baltimore, MD, USA. hkoenker@jhuccp.org

BACKGROUND: Tanzania achieved universal coverage with long-lasting insecticidal
nets (LLINs) in October 2011, after three years of free mass net distribution
campaigns and is now faced with the challenge of maintaining high coverage as
nets wear out and the population grows. A process of exploring options for a
continuous or "Keep-Up" distribution system was initiated in early 2011. This
paper presents for the first time a comprehensive national process to review the 
major considerations, findings and recommendations for the implementation of a
new strategy.
METHODS: Stakeholder meetings and site visits were conducted in five locations in
Tanzania to garner stakeholder input on the proposed distribution systems.
Coverage levels for LLINs and their decline over time were modelled using NetCALC
software, taking realistic net decay rates, current demographic profiles and
other relevant parameters into consideration. Costs of the different distribution
systems were estimated using local data.
RESULTS: LLIN delivery was considered via mass campaigns, Antenatal Care-Expanded
Programme on Immunization (ANC/EPI), community-based distribution, schools, the
commercial sector and different combinations of the above. Most approaches
appeared unlikely to maintain universal coverage when used alone. Mass campaigns,
even when combined with a continuation of the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme
(TNVS), would produce large temporal fluctuations in coverage levels; over 10
years this strategy would require 63.3 million LLINs and a total cost of $444
million USD. Community mechanisms, while able to deliver the required numbers of 
LLINs, would require a massive scale-up in monitoring, evaluation and supervision
systems to ensure accurate application of identification criteria at the
community level. School-based approaches combined with the existing TNVS would
reach most Tanzanian households and deliver 65.4 million LLINs over 10 years at a
total cost of $449 million USD and ensure continuous coverage. The cost of each
strategy was largely driven by the number of LLINs delivered.
CONCLUSIONS: The most cost-efficient strategy to maintain universal coverage is
one that best optimizes the numbers of LLINs needed over time. A school-based
approach using vouchers targeting all students in Standards 1, 3, 5, 7 and Forms 
1 and 2 in combination with the TNVS appears to meet best the criteria of
effectiveness, equity and efficiency.

Accuracy profiles assessing the validity for routine use of high-performance
thin-layer chromatographic assays for drug formulations.

Shewiyo DH, Kaale E, Risha PG, Dejaegher B, De Beer J, Smeyers-Verbeke J, Vander 
Heyden Y.

Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

The accuracy profile, based on total error, integrates several validation
parameters, such as trueness, precision and linearity, providing one statistic
which enables decision on the suitability of a method for its intended purpose.
Two assay methods for formulations are validated using accuracy profiles as an
alternative approach to classic method validation. It concerns high-performance
thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) methods, which initially were validated using
the classic approach. The first method assayed sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,
and the second lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine. Both formulations are
fixed-dose combination tablets. The resulting accuracy profiles showed that the
95% Î²-expectation tolerance limits for all compounds fell well within the bias
acceptance limits set at Â±5%. This means that the two analytical thin-layer
chromatographic methods are capable of making accurate results at the studied
concentration ranges of each compound. Measurement uncertainties of every
compound at each concentration level could also be determined from the accuracy
profile data.

High level of resistance in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae to pyrethroid
insecticides and reduced susceptibility to bendiocarb in north-western Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: To control malaria in Tanzania, two primary vector control
interventions are being scaled up: long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) 
and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The main threat to effective malaria control 
is the selection of insecticide resistance. While resistance to pyrethroids, the 
primary insecticide used for LLINs and IRS, has been reported among mosquito
vectors in only a few sites in Tanzania, neighbouring East African countries are 
recording increasing levels of resistance. To monitor the rapidly evolving
situation, the resistance status of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae s.l to
different insecticides and the prevalence of the kdr resistance allele involved
in pyrethroid resistance were investigated in north-western Tanzania, an area
that has been subject to several rounds of pyrethroid IRS since 2006.
METHODS: Household collections of anopheline mosquitoes were exposed to
diagnostic dosages of pyrethroid, DDT, and bendiocarb using WHO resistance test
kits. The relative proportions of An. gambiae s.s and Anopheles arabiensis were
also investigated among mosquitoes sampled using indoor CDC light traps.
Anophelines were identified to species and the kdr mutation was detected using
real time PCR TaqMan assays.
RESULTS: From the light trap collections 80% of An. gambiae s.l were identified
as An. gambiae s.s and 20% as An. arabiensis. There was cross-resistance between 
pyrethroids and DDT with mortality no higher than 40% reported in any of the
resistance tests. The kdr-eastern variant was present in homozygous form in 97%
of An. gambiae s.s but was absent in An. arabiensis. Anopheles gambiae s.s showed
reduced susceptibility to the carbamate insecticide, bendiocarb, the proportion
surviving WHO tests ranging from 0% to 30% depending on season and location.
CONCLUSION: Anopheles gambiae s.s has developed phenotypic resistance to
pyrethroids and DDT and kdr frequency has almost reached fixation. Unlike in
coastal Tanzania, where the ratio of An. gambiae s.s to An. arabiensis has
decreased in response to vector control, An. gambiae s.s persists at high
frequency in north-western Tanzania, probably due to selection of pyrethroid
resistance, and this trend is likely to arise in other areas as resistance
spreads or is subject to local selection from IRS or LLINs.

Unsafe abortion in Tanzania: a review of the evidence.

Woog V, Pembe AB.

Guttmacher Institute

Although pregnancy termination is restricted by law in Tanzania, it is widely
practiced and almost always unsafe,and contributes to the country's high maternal
morbidity and mortality. Yet the majority of abortion-related deaths are
preventable, as are the unintended pregnancies associated with abortion. Better
access to contraceptives, more comprehensive postabortion care and greater
availability of safe abortion services within the current legal framework are
critical to achieving the Millennium Development Goal 5 of reducing maternal
mortality and ensuring universal access to reproductive health care by 2015.

BACKGROUND: The development of low-cost point-of-care technologies to improve HIV
treatment is a major focus of current research in resource-limited settings.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations of body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) at
antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and weight change after 1 mo of treatment
with mortality, morbidity, and CD4 T cell reconstitution.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort of 3389 Tanzanian adults initiating ART enrolled in 
a multivitamin trial was followed at monthly clinic visits (median: 19.7 mo).
Proportional hazard models were used to analyze mortality and morbidity
associations, whereas generalized estimating equations were used for CD4 T cell
counts.
RESULTS: The median weight change at 1 mo of ART was +2.0% (IQR: -0.4% to +4.6%).
The association of weight loss at 1 mo with subsequent mortality varied
significantly by baseline BMI (P = 0.011). Participants with â‰¥2.5% weight loss
had 6.43 times (95% CI: 3.78, 10.93 times) the hazard of mortality compared with 
that of participants with weight gains â‰¥2.5%, if their baseline BMI was <18.5 but
only 2.73 times (95% CI: 1.49, 5.00 times) the hazard of mortality if their
baseline BMI was â‰¥18.5 and <25.0. Weight loss at 1 mo was also associated with
incident pneumonia (P = 0.002), oral thrush (P = 0.007), and pulmonary
tuberculosis (P < 0.001) but not change in CD4 T cell counts (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss as early as 1 mo after ART initiation can identify
adults at high risk of adverse outcomes. Studies identifying reasons for and
managing early weight loss are needed to improve HIV treatment, with particular
urgency for malnourished adults initiating ART. The parent trial was registered
at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00383669.

Advanced abdominal pregnancies with live twin fetuses are extremely rare and are 
misdiagnosed in up to 60% of the cases. Such a case is presented here,
highlighting the diagnostic and management challenges encountered. A high index
of suspicion in making the diagnosis of this rare variety of ectopic pregnancy,
emphasizing adherence to basic imaging principles, and appropriate placental
management is very important in reducing the associated morbidity and mortality.

Standardizing operational vector sampling techniques for measuring malaria
transmission intensity: evaluation of six mosquito collection methods in western 
Kenya.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Parasitic Diseases and
Malaria, Atlanta, GA, USA. vsm0@cdc.gov

BACKGROUND: Operational vector sampling methods lack standardization, making
quantitative comparisons of malaria transmission across different settings
difficult. Human landing catch (HLC) is considered the research gold standard for
measuring human-mosquito contact, but is unsuitable for large-scale sampling.
This study assessed mosquito catch rates of CDC light trap (CDC-LT), Ifakara tent
trap (ITT), window exit trap (WET), pot resting trap (PRT), and box resting trap 
(BRT) relative to HLC in western Kenya to 1) identify appropriate methods for
operational sampling in this region, and 2) contribute to a larger, overarching
project comparing standardized evaluations of vector trapping methods across
multiple countries.
METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected from June to July 2009 in four districts:
Rarieda, Kisumu West, Nyando, and Rachuonyo. In each district, all trapping
methods were rotated 10 times through three houses in a 3 Ã— 3 Latin Square
design. Anophelines were identified by morphology and females classified as fed
or non-fed. Anopheles gambiae s.l. were further identified as Anopheles gambiae
s.s. or Anopheles arabiensis by PCR. Relative catch rates were estimated by
negative binomial regression.
RESULTS: When data were pooled across all four districts, catch rates (relative
to HLC indoor) for An. gambiae s.l (95.6% An. arabiensis, 4.4% An. gambiae s.s)
were high for HLC outdoor (RR = 1.01), CDC-LT (RR = 1.18), and ITT (RR = 1.39);
moderate for WET (RR = 0.52) and PRT outdoor (RR = 0.32); and low for all
remaining types of resting traps (PRT indoor, BRT indoor, and BRT outdoor; RR <
0.08 for all). For Anopheles funestus, relative catch rates were high for ITT (RR
= 1.21); moderate for HLC outdoor (RR = 0.47), CDC-LT (RR = 0.69), and WET (RR = 
0.49); and low for all resting traps (RR < 0.02 for all). At finer geographic
scales, however, efficacy of each trap type varied from district to district.
CONCLUSIONS: ITT, CDC-LT, and WET appear to be effective methods for large-scale 
vector sampling in western Kenya. Ultimately, choice of collection method for
operational surveillance should be driven by trap efficacy and scalability,
rather than fine-scale precision with respect to HLC. When compared with recent, 
similar trap evaluations in Tanzania and Zambia, these data suggest that traps
which actively lure host-seeking females will be most useful for surveillance in 
the face of declining vector densities.

Provincialization of terrestrial faunas following the end-Permian mass
extinction.

In addition to their devastating effects on global biodiversity, mass extinctions
have had a long-term influence on the history of life by eliminating dominant
lineages that suppressed ecological change. Here, we test whether the end-Permian
mass extinction (252.3 Ma) affected the distribution of tetrapod faunas within
the southern hemisphere and apply quantitative methods to analyze four components
of biogeographic structure: connectedness, clustering, range size, and endemism. 
For all four components, we detected increased provincialism between our Permian 
and Triassic datasets. In southern Pangea, a more homogeneous and broadly
distributed fauna in the Late Permian (Wuchiapingian, âˆ¼257 Ma) was replaced by a 
provincial and biogeographically fragmented fauna by Middle Triassic times
(Anisian, âˆ¼242 Ma). Importantly in the Triassic, lower latitude basins in
Tanzania and Zambia included dinosaur predecessors and other archosaurs unknown
elsewhere. The recognition of heterogeneous tetrapod communities in the Triassic 
implies that the end-Permian mass extinction afforded ecologically marginalized
lineages the ecospace to diversify, and that biotic controls (i.e., evolutionary 
incumbency) were fundamentally reset. Archosaurs, which began diversifying in the
Early Triassic, were likely beneficiaries of this ecological release and remained
dominant for much of the later Mesozoic.

Low rates of repeat HIV testing despite increased availability of antiretroviral 
therapy in rural Tanzania: findings from 2003-2010.

BACKGROUND: HIV counselling and testing (HCT) services can play an important role
in HIV prevention by encouraging safe sexual behaviours and linking HIV-infected 
clients to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, regular repeat testing by
high-risk HIV-negative individuals is important for timely initiation of ART as
part of the 'treatment as prevention' approach.
AIM: To investigate HCT use during a round of HIV serological surveillance in
northwest Tanzania in 2010, and to explore rates of repeat testing between 2003
and 2010.
METHODS: HCT services were provided during the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds of 
serological surveillance in 2003-2004 (Sero-4), 2006-2007 (Sero-5) and 2010
(Sero-6). HCT services have also been available at a government-run health centre
and at other clinics in the study area since 2005. Questionnaires administered
during sero-surveys collected information on socio-demographic characteristics,
sexual behaviour and reported previous use of HCT services.
RESULTS: The proportion of participants using HCT increased from 9.4% at Sero-4
to 16.6% at Sero-5 and 25.5% at Sero-6. Among participants attending all three
sero-survey rounds (nâ€Š=â€Š2,010), the proportions using HCT twice or more were low,
with 11.1% using the HCT service offered at sero-surveys twice or more, and 25.3%
having tested twice or more if reported use of HCT outside of sero-surveys was
taken into account. In multivariable analyses, individuals testing HIV-positive
were less likely to repeat test than individuals testing HIV-negative (aOR 0.17, 
95% CI 0.006-0.52).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Although HCT service use increased over time, it was
disappointing that the proportions ever testing and ever repeat-testing were not 
even larger, considering the increasing availability of HCT and ART in the study 
area. There was some evidence that HIV-negative people with higher risk sexual
behaviours were most likely to repeat test, which was encouraging in terms of the
potential to pick-up those at greatest risk of HIV-infection.

Risk Factors for Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Tanzania, 2001-2006.

Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA), UAB-IRTA, Campus de la Universitat
AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Departament de Sanitat i Anatomia
Animals, Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

We developed a model to quantify the effect of factors influencing the
spatio-temporal distribution of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Tanzania. The
land area of Tanzania was divided into a regular grid of 20Â kmÂ Ã—Â 20Â km cells and 
separate grids constructed for each of the 12-month periods between 2001 and
2006. For each year, a cell was classified as either FMD positive or negative
dependent on an outbreak being recorded in any settlement within the cell
boundaries. A Bayesian mixed-effects spatial model was developed to assess the
association between the risk of FMD occurrence and distance to main roads,
railway lines, wildlife parks, international borders and cattle density.
Increases in the distance to main roads decreased the risk of FMD every year from
2001 to 2006 (ORs ranged from 0.43 to 0.97). Increases in the distance to railway
lines and international borders were, in general, associated with a decreased
risk of FMD (ORs ranged from 0.85 to 0.99). Increases in the distance from a
national park decreased the risk of FMD in 2001 (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68-0.93) but
had the opposite effect in 2004 (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01-1.12). Cattle population
density was, in general, positively associated with the risk of FMD (ORs ranged
from 1.01 to 1.30). The spatial distribution of high-risk areas was variable and 
corresponded to endemic (2001, 2002 and 2005) and epidemic (2003, 2004 and 2006) 
phases. Roads played a dominant role in both epidemiological situations; we
hypothesize that roads are the main driver of FMD expansion in Tanzania. Our
results suggest that FMD occurrence in Tanzania is more related to animal
movement and human activity via communication networks than transboundary
movements or contact with wildlife.

An abattoir survey of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia lesions in slaughtered
cattle in selected districts in Northern Tanzania.

Veterinary Investigation Centre (VIC), Box 1068, Arusha, Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE: To establish and estimate incidence of contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia (CBPP), using abattoir survey as a diagnostic tool in slaughtered
cattle in Northern Tanzania.
METHODS: A total of 4â€…460 cattle were slaughtered in five abattoirs in 3 northern
zone regions (Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Tanga) during the period of January to May 
2004. They were examined ante-mortem for 'pneumonia signs', and 'characteristic
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) lung lesions'.
RESULTS: Forty-one (0.91%) of the slaughtered cattle, the majority of which were 
Tanzania short horn zebu, had gross lung lesions suggestive of CBPP. The
prevalence of lesions was significantly (P<0.05) higher in Karatu abattoir
compared to others. No animal was detected to have lesion in Bomang' ombe
abattoir. The most observed pneumonic signs included labored breathing (90%), dry
cough (57%) and mucopurulent nasal discharge (47%). The gross characteristic CBPP
pathological lesion, frequently encountered was left lung lesion (47%), pinkish
lung (71%) and pleural adhesion (98%). Epidemiological reports show that the CBPP
reported outbreaks increased from 19 in 2002, 65 in 2003 and 18 in 2004
(January-March). The corresponding number of reported deaths increased from 137
in 2002, 269 in 2003 and 77 in 2004 (January-March).
CONCLUSIONS: It's concluded from this study that CBPP is a problem in spite of
the extensive awareness and vaccination campaigns. Nevertheless, a continued
surveillance programme including routine checks of all cattle carcasses at the
abattoir and subsequent epidemiological investigation of suspected cases are
recommended.

Uninfected Infants.

Salaam, Tanzania.

Vitamin D is essential for bone development and may also play an integral role in
control of intracellular pathogens. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were
assessed at 6 months of age for 191 HIV-exposed uninfected infants enrolled in a 
trial of multivitamins (not including vitamin D) in Tanzania. A total of 66
infants (34.6%) were classified as vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/ml), 93 (48.7%) as
vitamin D insufficient (20-30 ng/ml) and 32 (16.8%) as vitamin D sufficient (â‰¥30 
ng/ml). Independent risk factors for vitamin D deficiency were sampling during
the rainy season and infant wasting. Infant breastfeeding, maternal CD4 T-cell
count, maternal wasting status and maternal receipt of antiretroviral therapy
were not associated with vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of vitamin D were
highly prevalent among HIV-exposed uninfected infants in Tanzania, and
longitudinal studies and clinical trials of supplementation are needed to assess 
the impact on child health.

OBJECTIVE: Febrile seizures may contribute to epilepsy later in life, but data in
sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. We, therefore, conducted a hospital-based study on
clinical characteristics of children with febrile seizures.
METHODS: Over 2 years, we screened all pediatric admissions of Haydom Lutheran
Hospital, northern Tanzania, and recruited 197 children with febrile seizures.
RESULTS: The incidence of febrile seizures was 4% of all admitted children aged
<10 years, with a mortality of almost 4%. The peak age at the first febrile
seizure was 2 years. One of five children experienced repeated episodes, and the 
majority of children showed features of complex seizures. Approximately 20% of
children had a positive family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy.
CONCLUSION: Febrile seizures represent a frequent cause for admission of
children, bearing a rather high mortality. Most children exhibit complex febrile 
seizures, which may contribute to the development of epilepsy later in life.

Clinical performance of an automated reader in interpreting malaria rapid
diagnostic tests in Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: Parasitological confirmation of malaria is now recommended in all
febrile patients by the World Health Organization (WHO) to reduce inappropriate
use of anti-malarial drugs. Widespread implementation of rapid diagnostic tests
(RDTs) is regarded as an effective strategy to achieve this goal. However, the
quality of diagnosis provided by RDTs in remote rural dispensaries and health
centres is not ideal. Feasible RDT quality control programmes in these settings
are challenging. Collection of information regarding diagnostic events is also
very deficient in low-resource countries.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of consecutive patients aged more than one year
from both genders, seeking routine care for febrile episodes at dispensaries
located in the Bagamoyo district of Tanzania, were enrolled into the study after 
signing an informed consent form. Blood samples were taken for thick blood smear 
(TBS) microscopic examination and malaria RDT (SD Bioline Malaria Antigen Pf/Panâ„¢
(SD RDT)). RDT results were interpreted by both visual interpretation and Deki
Readerâ„¢ device. Results of visual interpretation were used for case management
purposes. Microscopy was considered the "gold standard test" to assess the
sensitivity and specificity of the Deki Reader interpretation and to compare it
to visual interpretation.
RESULTS: In total, 1,346 febrile subjects were included in the final analysis.
The SD RDT, when used in conjunction with the Deki Reader and upon visual
interpretation, had sensitivities of 95.3% (95% CI, 90.6-97.7) and 94.7% (95% CI,
89.8-97.3) respectively, and specificities of 94.6% (95% CI, 93.5-96.1) and 95.6%
(95% CI, 94.2-96.6), respectively to gold standard. There was a high percentage
of overall agreement between the two methods of interpretation.
CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of the Deki Reader in interpretation 
of SD RDTs were comparable to previous reports and showed high agreement to
visual interpretation (>98%). The results of the study reflect the situation in
real practice and show good performance characteristics of Deki Reader on
interpreting malaria RDTs in the hands of local laboratory technicians. They also
suggest that a system like this could provide great benefits to the health care
system. Further studies to look at ease of use by community health workers, and
cost benefit of the system are warranted.

Motivation and incentives of rural maternal and neonatal health care providers: a
comparison of qualitative findings from Burkina Faso, Ghana and Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: In Burkina Faso, Ghana and Tanzania strong efforts are being made to 
improve the quality of maternal and neonatal health (MNH) care. However, progress
is impeded by challenges, especially in the area of human resources. All three
countries are striving not only to scale up the number of available health staff,
but also to improve performance by raising skill levels and enhancing provider
motivation.
METHODS: In-depth interviews were used to explore MNH provider views about
motivation and incentives at primary care level in rural Burkina Faso, Ghana and 
Tanzania. Interviews were held with 25 MNH providers, 8 facility and district
managers, and 2 policy-makers in each country.
RESULTS: Across the three countries some differences were found in the reasons
why people became health workers. Commitment to remaining a health worker was
generally high. The readiness to remain at a rural facility was far less,
although in all settings there were some providers that were willing to stay. In 
Burkina Faso it appeared to be particularly difficult to recruit female MNH
providers to rural areas. There were indications that MNH providers in all the
settings sometimes failed to treat their patients well. This was shown to be
interlinked with differences in how the term 'motivation' was understood, and in 
the views held about remuneration and the status of rural health work. Job
satisfaction was shown to be quite high, and was particularly linked to community
appreciation. With some important exceptions, there was a strong level of
agreement regarding the financial and non-financial incentives that were
suggested by these providers, but there were clear country preferences as to
whether incentives should be for individuals or teams.
CONCLUSIONS: Understandings of the terms and concepts pertaining to motivation
differed between the three countries. The findings from Burkina Faso underline
the importance of gender-sensitive health workforce planning. The training that
all levels of MNH providers receive in professional ethics, and the way this is
reinforced in practice require closer attention. The differences in the findings 
across the three settings underscore the importance of in-depth country-level
research to tailor the development of incentives schemes.

Clean home-delivery in rural Southern Tanzania: barriers, influencers, and
facilitators.

The study explored the childbirth-related hygiene and newborn care practices in
home-deliveries in Southern Tanzania and barriers to and facilitators of
behaviour change. Eleven home-birth narratives and six focus group discussions
were conducted with recently-delivering women; two focus group discussions were
conducted with birth attendants. The use of clean cloth for delivery was reported
as common in the birth narratives; however, respondents did not link its use to
newborn's health. Handwashing and wearing of gloves by birth attendants varied
and were not discussed in terms of being important for newborn's health, with few
women giving reasons for this behaviour. The lack of handwashing and wearing of
gloves was most commonly linked to the lack of water, gloves, and awareness. A
common practice was the insertion of any family member's hands into the vagina of
delivering woman to check labour progress before calling the birth attendant. The
use of a new razor blade to cut the cord was near-universal; however, the cord
was usually tied with a used thread due to the lack of knowledge and the low
availability of clean thread. Applying something to the cord was near-universal
and was considered essential for newborn's health. Three hygiene practices were
identified as needing improvement: family members inserting a hand into the
vagina of delivering woman before calling the birth attendant, the use of unclean
thread, and putting substances on the cord. Little is known about families
conducting internal checks of women in labour, and more research is needed before
this behaviour is targeted in interventions. The use of clean thread as cord-tie 
appears acceptable and can be addressed, using the same channels and methods that
were used for successfully encouraging the use of new razor blade.
