=cut
Sometimes you will find that you do need to use either backslashes. 
For example, if you want to print a dollar sign and then an amount in a 
variable, you could use either: 
=cut

say "output 6, strange cases";
my $amount = 40.00;
#use the list print command
say 'The amount is $' , 
			$amount;
#say you can put mulpile lines into one print statement
say "The amount " ,
			"\$" , $amount;
