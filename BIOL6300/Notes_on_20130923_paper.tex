\section{Elevator Speech}
This paper is about the development of protein micro-arrays.  The proteins are covalently bonded to a glass slide in their natural conformation , enabling the use of existing micro-array equipment to conduct analysis.\\
Currently, there are three analytical uses of this new method.  The observation of protein-protein interactions, the identification of substrates of protein kinases and the identification of protein targets of small molecules.\\
Due to the slides high density of 1600 spots per square centimetre and the need for only a few micro-litres of each protein, sufficient to fabricate thousands of micro-arrays, purified proteins are readily obtained through high-throughput expression.
