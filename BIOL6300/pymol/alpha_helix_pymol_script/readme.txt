This directory contains coordinate files and pymol script files for studying alpha helices. The script will only work after you download and install the program Pymol.

Associate the files with Pymol. To do this, set your computer so that when you double-click on any file named file.pml or file.pdb your computer recognizes the file name extension, it opens these files in Pymol.

Once file.pml and file.pdb are associated with Pymol, then double click on file.pml.
